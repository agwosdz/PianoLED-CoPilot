# üéõÔ∏è Fix: MIDI Input Selection Wonky

## Problem
MIDI input device selection was defaulting to "MIDI Through Port" instead of showing physical devices first.

## Root Cause
1. **Frontend**: The `selected={device.is_current}` attribute in HTML options doesn't work in Svelte - must let `bind:value` handle selection
2. **Backend**: The device list included virtual/loopback ports like "MIDI Through Port" without filtering, causing them to appear first

## Solution Applied

### Frontend Fix (play/+page.svelte, line 450-460)
- ‚úÖ Removed the non-functional `selected={device.is_current}` attribute
- ‚úÖ Let `bind:value` properly manage selection
- ‚úÖ Added visual indicator "(current)" to show which device is selected

### Backend Fix (backend/midi/usb_port_manager.py)
Updated `list_devices()` method to:

1. **Separate** devices into two categories:
   - Physical devices (keyboards, interfaces, controllers)
   - Virtual devices (MIDI Through Port, RtMidOut, USB-USB, Loopback, Virtual)

2. **Return physical devices first**, followed by virtual devices
   - This ensures real MIDI controllers appear at the top
   - Virtual ports are still available if user wants them

3. **Filter keywords detected**:
   - "Through" ‚Üí MIDI Through Port
   - "RtMidOut" ‚Üí rtMIDI virtual outputs
   - "USB-USB" ‚Üí Self-loops
   - "Loopback" ‚Üí Jack loopback ports
   - "Virtual" ‚Üí Explicitly virtual ports

## Behavior Changes
‚úÖ Physical MIDI devices now appear first in the dropdown
‚úÖ Virtual ports appear at the end (still usable but not default)
‚úÖ Selection now properly tracks current device
‚úÖ Visual feedback shows which device is currently selected with "(current)" label

## Testing
1. Load the UI
2. Check MIDI input device dropdown
3. Should see physical keyboard/interface first
4. "MIDI Through Port" should appear at the very end
5. Selecting a device should immediately connect to it

## Example Device Order
**Before**: MIDI Through Port, KeyStation, ...
**After**: KeyStation, ..., MIDI Through Port
