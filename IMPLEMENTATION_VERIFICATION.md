## Performance Metrics (Projected)

### Memory Usage
- DOM Renderer: 50-100 MB (919 divs)
- Canvas Renderer: 5-10 MB (1 canvas element)
- **Improvement: 80-90% reduction** ✅

### Frame Rate (Desktop)
- DOM Renderer: 40-50 FPS
- Canvas Renderer: 58-60 FPS
- **Improvement: ~20% faster** ✅

### Frame Rate (Pi Zero 2W - Expected)
- DOM Renderer: 20-30 FPS
- Canvas Renderer: 50-60 FPS
- **Improvement: 100-200% faster** ✅

### CPU Usage (Projected)
- DOM Renderer: Higher (many layout/paint operations)
- Canvas Renderer: Lower (single element rendering)
- **Improvement: Proportional to FPS gain** ✅

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Canvas size limited to browser max (~8192x8192)
- Current implementation uses 800x600 (within limits)
- Color precision: Hex to RGB conversion (imperceptible difference)
- Font rendering varies by OS/browser (acceptable)

### Future Opportunities
- Viewport culling for 1000+ note files
- Level-of-detail rendering (zoom in/out)
- WebGL variant for desktop
- GPU-accelerated rendering on capable devices
- Performance monitoring UI

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If Canvas renderer causes issues:
1. Uncheck "Use Canvas Renderer" checkbox
2. Reverts to DOM renderer immediately
3. No data loss or state issues
4. Can debug Canvas issues separately
