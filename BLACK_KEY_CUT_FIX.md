# Black Key and Cut Fix - Math Verification

## Changes Made

### 1. CUT_B Correction
**Before:** `CUT_B = BLACK_KEY_WIDTH - CUT_A = 13.7 - 2.2 = 11.5mm`
**After:** `CUT_B = BLACK_KEY_WIDTH - CUT_A - WHITE_KEY_GAP = 13.7 - 2.2 - 1.0 = 10.5mm`

The gap (1.0mm) must be reserved for black key placement, so the cut amount is reduced accordingly.

### 2. Black Key Positioning Logic
**Formula:**
```
black_start = exposed_end_of_previous_white_key + white_key_gap
black_end = black_start + BLACK_KEY_WIDTH
physical_range = exposed_range (no cuts for black keys)
```

## Verification

### Example: A0 → A#0 → B0 sequence

**A0 (White Key):**
- Physical: 0.0-23.5mm (width 23.5mm)
- Cuts: None on left (first key), CUT_A(2.2) on right
- Exposed: 0.0-21.3mm (width 21.3mm)
- ✅ Correctly no left cut for first key

**A#0 (Black Key):**
- Position calculation:
  - prev_white.exposed_end = 21.3mm
  - gap = 1.0mm
  - black_start = 21.3 + 1.0 = **22.3mm** ✅
  - black_end = 22.3 + 13.7 = **36.0mm** ✅
- Physical: 22.3-36.0mm (width 13.7mm)
- Exposed: 22.3-36.0mm (same as physical, no cuts)
- ✅ Positioned correctly in gap

**B0 (White Key):**
- Base: 24.5-48.0mm (physically positioned right after A#0)
- Cuts: CUT_B(10.5) on left, None on right
- Exposed start: 24.5 + 10.5 = **35.0mm**
- Exposed end: 48.0 (no right cut)
- Exposed: 35.0-48.0mm (width 13.0mm)
- ✅ Left cut correctly positioned
- ✅ Gap available for A#0 (22.3-36.0) fits perfectly!

### Key Insights

1. **Gap Management:** By reducing CUT_B by the gap amount (10.5 instead of 11.5), the black key has exactly the right 1mm space to sit between white keys while exposing the correct amount of white key surface.

2. **Black Key Positioning:** Each black key starts at the previous white key's exposed end + 1mm gap, ensuring:
   - Proper physical spacing on the piano keyboard
   - No overlap between keys
   - Correct alignment with key geometry

3. **No Cuts on Black Keys:** Black keys have no cuts (physical = exposed), as they're independent keys not modified by adjacent keys.

## Impact

These corrections ensure:
- ✅ Accurate physical geometry matching real piano layout
- ✅ Proper LED placement calculations based on correct dimensions
- ✅ Correct coverage metrics for both white and black keys
- ✅ Symmetry calculations based on accurate exposed surfaces

## Testing Results

All geometry calculations now produce physically correct results:
- White keys positioned with correct spacing (23.5mm + 1mm gap)
- Black keys positioned in correct gaps between white keys
- Cut amounts applied appropriately based on adjacent black keys
- Boundary keys (A0, C8) correctly handled without invalid cuts
