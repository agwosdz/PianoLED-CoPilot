# LED Customization Enhancement - Complete Summary

## What Was Added

The LED customization interface now shows currently allocated LEDs as visual, interactive representations with smart reallocation capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Visual Current Allocation
- Shows exactly which LEDs are currently assigned to the selected key
- Large, prominent buttons (45px) with green gradient
- Count badge showing total number of LEDs
- Easy to distinguish from manual selection grid

### 2. Smart Reallocation
- Click any assigned LED to mark it for reallocation
- System automatically determines adjacent key based on position
- Left edge LEDs move to previous key (lower MIDI)
- Right edge LEDs move to next key (higher MIDI)
- Visual feedback with red buttons and ✕ indicators

### 3. Dual Grid Interface
**Current Allocation Grid:**
- Shows only LEDs currently assigned to the key
- Large buttons for easy clicking
- Green for still-selected, red for removed
- Purpose: Quick overview and click-based reallocation

**Manual LED Selection Grid:**
- Shows entire valid LED range (e.g., 120-246)
- Small, compact buttons (35px)
- Yellow highlights for currently assigned LEDs
- Blue highlights for selected modifications
- Purpose: Manual fine-tuning and cross-key LED selection

### 4. Pre-populated Selection
- When user selects a MIDI note, the form automatically loads:
  - Current LED allocation from `ledMapping[midiNote]`
  - Any existing overrides from `ledSelectionState.overrides[midiNote]`
  - Pre-selects these in the custom selection
- User can immediately see what's currently assigned

## User Experience Flow

### Simple Case: Remove One LED
```
1. Select MIDI 60
2. See current LEDs: [120, 121, 122, 123]
3. Click LED 122 (red button appears with ✕)
4. Click "✓ Add Adjustment"
5. Result: LED 122 reallocates to key 61
```

### Complex Case: Manual Reallocation
```
1. Select MIDI 60 (current: [120, 121, 122, 123])
2. Click LED 120 (remove from left)
3. Scroll down to manual grid
4. Click LED 125 (yellow, currently elsewhere)
5. Now custom selection: [121, 122, 123, 125]
6. Click "✓ Add Adjustment"
7. Result:
   - LED 120 moves to key 59
   - LED 125 added to key 60
```

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```typescript
let currentKeyLEDAllocation: number[] = [];  // Current LEDs for selected key
let allKeysLEDMapping: Record<number, number[]> = {};  // All keys' allocations
```

### Enhanced handleMidiNoteInput()
```typescript
function handleMidiNoteInput(midiNoteStr: string) {
  // 1. Load available LEDs
  // 2. Load current allocation from ledMapping
  // 3. Load existing override
  // 4. Pre-populate selectedLEDsForNewKey
}
```

### New handleReallocateLED()
```typescript
function handleReallocateLED(ledIndex: number) {
  // 1. Remove from current key
  // 2. Calculate midpoint to determine edge
  // 3. Determine target adjacent key
  // 4. Show feedback message
}
```

### New CSS Classes
```css
.current-allocation        /* Container for current LEDs */
.led-grid-current         /* Grid for current LEDs */
.led-button-assigned      /* Individual current LED button */
.led-button-assigned.removed  /* Marked for removal */
.allocation-header        /* Title and count badge */
.allocation-title         /* "Currently Assigned LEDs" text */
.allocation-count         /* Count badge styling */
.allocation-hint          /* Hint text */
.full-grid-header         /* "Manual Selection" header */
.led-button-compact.current  /* Yellow highlight for current */
```

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
| Element | Color | Use |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Current (Active) | Green #66bb6a | LED still in selection |
| Current (Removed) | Red #ef5350 | LED marked for removal |
| Current (Manual) | Yellow #fff9c4 | Currently assigned (in manual grid) |
| Modified Selected | Green #66bb6a | Manually selected in custom |
| Default | White | Available for selection |

### Button Sizes
- Current allocation: **45px** (prominent, easy to click)
- Manual grid: **35px** (compact, comprehensive)

### Styling Details
- Gradient backgrounds for visual depth
- Box shadows for current LEDs (green) and removed LEDs (red)
- Checkmarks for selected LEDs
- ✕ indicators for removed LEDs
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)
- Hover effects with scale (1.05-1.1)

## Data Flow

### When MIDI Note Entered
```
User enters MIDI 60
    ↓
handleMidiNoteInput("60")
    ├─ Parse and validate
    ├─ Load ledMapping[60] → [120, 121, 122, 123]
    ├─ Check ledSelectionState.overrides[60]
    ├─ Pre-populate selectedLEDsForNewKey
    └─ Initialize availableLEDsForForm
    ↓
Display current allocation as green buttons
Display manual grid with yellow highlights
```

### When LED Clicked (Reallocation)
```
User clicks LED 122 in current allocation
    ↓
handleReallocateLED(122)
    ├─ Remove from selectedLEDsForNewKey
    ├─ Calculate midpoint (121.5)
    ├─ 122 > 121.5 → right edge
    ├─ Target = MIDI 61 (next key)
    └─ Show: "LED 122 will move to key C# when saved"
    ↓
Button turns red with ✕ indicator
```

### When "Add Adjustment" Clicked
```
handleAddKeyOffset()
    ├─ Save offset to calibration API
    ├─ selectedLEDsForNewKey = [121, 122, 123]
    ├─ currentKeyLEDAllocation = [120, 121, 122, 123]
    ├─ Diff: removed [120]
    │
    ├─ Save LED override to LED selection API
    ├─ Backend receives removed LED 120
    ├─ Backend reallocates 120 to MIDI 61
    └─ All systems updated atomically
    ↓
Success message shown
Form reset
List updated with new adjustment
```

## Testing Scenarios

```
✓ Select MIDI 60
✓ Current: [120, 121, 122, 123]
✓ Click LED 120 (left edge)
✓ Verify: Button turns red with ✕
✓ Save and verify LED 120 moved to MIDI 59
```

### Test 2: Reallocation Right Edge

```

### Test 3: Middle LED
```
✓ Select MIDI 60

✓ Save and verify
```

### Test 5: Complex Multi-Key
```
✓ Edit Key 60: remove [120], add [124]
✓ Edit Key 62: remove [125]
✓ Save all changes
✓ Verify cascade effects
✓ Verify no LED conflicts
```

### Test 6: Pre-population
```
