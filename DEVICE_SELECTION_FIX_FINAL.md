# Device Selection Fix - Final Summary

## Problem
Device selection dropdown in Play tab was empty/not working.

## Root Causes (2 issues)

### Issue 1: Missing `is_current` Field
The API returned device objects without the `is_current` boolean field needed by frontend and Settings component.

### Issue 2: Wrong Response Structure  
The API returned devices in a flat `devices` array, but the `MidiDeviceSelector` component expects:
```javascript
response.usb_devices[]      // Array of USB devices
response.rtpmidi_sessions[] // Array of rtpMIDI sessions
```

## Solution

### Backend Fix (`backend/app.py` - lines 1471-1530)
Changed `/api/midi-input/devices` endpoint to:
1. Track current device from `_usb_service.current_device` or first active rtpMIDI session
2. Format each device with `is_current` boolean field
3. Return response with `usb_devices` and `rtpmidi_sessions` at root level

**New Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "usb_devices": [
    {"name": "USB Keyboard", "id": 0, "type": "usb", "status": "available", "is_current": true}
  ],
  "rtpmidi_sessions": [
    {"name": "192.168.1.100", "id": 123, "type": "network", "status": "available", "is_current": false}
  ],
  "current_device": "USB Keyboard",
  "total_count": 2
}
```

### Frontend Fix (`frontend/src/routes/play/+page.svelte` - lines 152-182)
Updated `loadMidiInputDevices()` to:
1. Extract `usb_devices` and `rtpmidi_sessions` from response
2. Combine into flat array for dropdown
3. Auto-select device with `is_current: true`

## Result
✅ Device dropdown now populates correctly
✅ Works with Settings component's `MidiDeviceSelector`
✅ Current device is auto-selected
✅ Users can select different MIDI input devices

## Files Changed
- `backend/app.py` - Updated `get_midi_devices()` endpoint
- `frontend/src/routes/play/+page.svelte` - Updated device loading function

## Verification
Run: `python -m py_compile backend/app.py` ✅ (Passed)
