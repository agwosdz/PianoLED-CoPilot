## What Was Done This Session

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design ✅
- Analyzed piano key geometry (C-E groups, F-B groups, special edge cases)
- Determined 200 LEDs/m case is optimal with simple algorithm + calibration
- Concluded group-aware mapping unnecessary for current use case
- Documented precision analysis with full math

### Phase 2: Integration ✅
- Located calibration API blueprint in `backend/api/calibration.py`
- Added import for `calculate_physical_led_mapping()` function
- Created new `/api/calibration/mapping-quality` endpoint (163 lines)
- Full error handling, validation, and logging included

### Phase 3: Testing ✅
- Started Flask backend on localhost:5001
- Tested new endpoint with GET request
- Verified JSON response with full quality analysis
- Confirmed response includes:
  - Quality score (0-100)
  - Quality level (poor/ok/good/excellent)
  - LEDs per key calculation
  - Coverage ratio
  - Warnings and recommendations
  - Hardware and physical analysis

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅
- Created `INTEGRATION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive API docs)
- Created `PI_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (Raspberry Pi deployment steps)
- Created `PRECISION_ANALYSIS_200LED.md` (geometry analysis)

## The Algorithm in Action

**What the endpoint does:**

1. **Receives calibration parameters** (or uses current settings)
   ```
   LED density: 200 per meter → 5mm spacing between LEDs
   Piano range: A0-C8 → 1273mm physical width
   Piano size: 88-key → 52 white keys
   ```

2. **Calls physical mapping algorithm**
   ```
   Calculates coverage ratio:
   246 available LEDs × 5mm = 1230mm coverage
   1230mm coverage ÷ 1273mm piano = 0.966 ratio
   ```

3. **Scores the mapping quality**
   ```
   Excellent: 0.95 ratio is ideal range
   4.73 LEDs per key is balanced
   No warnings or oversaturation
   Quality score: 95/100
   ```

4. **Generates recommendations**
   ```
   This configuration is optimal
   Suitable for all use cases
   No changes recommended
   ```

5. **Returns comprehensive analysis**
   ```
   User sees quality indicator: EXCELLENT (95)
   User sees: "Perfect for your setup"
   User can proceed with calibration
   ```
