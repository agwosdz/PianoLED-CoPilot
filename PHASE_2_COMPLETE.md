## 🎯 Algorithm Flow

```
For each of 88 piano keys:
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 1. Get key geometry                      │
  │    (exposed playing surface range)       │
  │                                          │
  │ 2. Find overlapping LEDs                 │
  │    (any LED that touches key surface)    │
  │                                          │
  │ 3. Filter by threshold                   │
  │    (exclude if overhang > threshold)     │
  │                                          │
  │ 4. Calculate metrics                     │
  │    (coverage, symmetry, consistency)     │
  │                                          │
  │ Result: Optimal LED set for this key     │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
