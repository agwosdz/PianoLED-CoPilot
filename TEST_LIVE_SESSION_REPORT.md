# Falling Notes Visualization - Live Test Report

## Test Date
October 19, 2025

## Current Status: ✅ RENDERING CORRECTLY

### Visual Verification
- ✅ File browser: Shows 5 MIDI files available
- ✅ Play controls: Play and Stop buttons present
- ✅ Progress bar: Visible and ready
- ✅ Debug display: Shows all timing information
- ✅ Falling notes: **YELLOW BARS VISIBLE** in viewport
- ✅ Piano keyboard: Rendered at bottom with proper black/white key layout

### Debug Information Captured
```
Time: 0.00s / 0.00s | Playing: false
Notes: Loaded:453 | Visible:15 | Lookahead:4s
First note: MIDI 60 at 0.00s
Last note: MIDI 94 at 240.39s
First visible: MIDI 90 | timeUntil:0.00s | topPercent:100.0% | Should be at RIGHT (yellow)
```

### Analysis
1. **453 notes loaded** - File parsing working ✅
2. **15 visible notes** - Look-ahead window filtering working ✅
3. **topPercent: 100.0%** - First visible note is at bottom (keyboard level) ✅
4. **MIDI 90 (yellow)** - Hand detection working (≥54 = right hand = yellow) ✅
5. **Multiple yellow bars stacked** - Multiple notes visible in window ✅

## Next Phase: Playback Animation Test

### Test Procedure
1. **Click Play button**
2. **Observe**:
   - Debug shows "Playing: true"
   - Current time advances (0.00s → 0.10s → 0.20s...)
   - Notes fall from top to bottom (topPercent: 100% → 50% → 0%)
   - Piano keyboard highlights notes as they reach bottom
3. **Verify**:
   - Notes move smoothly (not jumpy)
   - Colors correct (orange = left, yellow = right)
   - Timing accurate to music

### Expected Behavior When Playing
```
Initial (t=0):
  Time: 0.00s / 240.39s | Playing: true
  First visible at 100% (at keyboard)

After 1 second (t=1):
  Time: 1.00s / 240.39s | Playing: true
  First visible at 75% (¾ way down)
  New notes entered from top

After 2 seconds (t=2):
  Time: 2.00s / 240.39s | Playing: true
  First visible at 50% (middle)
  Notes still falling smoothly

After 4 seconds (t=4):
  Time: 4.00s / 240.39s | Playing: true
  First visible at 0% (just reached keyboard!)
  Piano highlights this note
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Click Play → "Playing: true" appears
- [ ] Progress bar populates with total duration (240.39s = 4:00)
- [ ] Time advances: 0.00s → 0.10s → 0.20s...
- [ ] Notes fall smoothly from top to bottom
- [ ] Colors correct (yellow visible, should see orange for left hand notes)
- [ ] Piano highlights notes as they reach keyboard
- [ ] Pause button works (stops animation)
- [ ] Resume works (animation continues from same position)
- [ ] Stop button works (resets to start)

## Performance Notes
- Smooth 60fps rendering expected
- Debug updates every 500ms when playing
- 15 notes visible at any time = good balance for performance
- No visual stuttering observed in static render

## Next Steps
1. **Click Play** and capture animation sequence
2. **Verify timing accuracy** - does the animation sync with the audio?
3. **Test controls** - pause/resume/stop functionality
4. **Capture animation video** - document the falling notes effect
