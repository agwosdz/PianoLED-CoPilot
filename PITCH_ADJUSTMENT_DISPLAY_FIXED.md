# Pitch Adjustment Display - FIXED ✓

## Problem
Pitch adjustment display box was not automatically appearing after applying changes in Physics-Based LED Detection mode.

## Root Cause
The display box was only shown when `was_adjusted === true`, but:
1. Not all parameter changes result in pitch adjustment (if pitch already matches theoretical, no adjustment happens)
2. Users had no feedback about what the system did with pitch calibration
3. Made it unclear whether the feature was working or not

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Always Show Pitch Calibration Info
- Display box now appears **EVERY TIME** after applying changes (when in Physics-Based mode)
- Shows one of two states based on `was_adjusted` flag

### 2. Two Visual States

#### State 1: Pitch Was Adjusted (Yellow)
- **Background**: Yellow/amber gradient
- **Badge**: "ADJUSTED" in yellow
- **Shows**:
  - Theoretical pitch (mm)
  - Calibrated pitch (mm)
  - Difference in mm and percentage
  - Reason for adjustment
- **Example**: "Actual LED range (247 LEDs) spans 1235mm, requiring pitch adjustment"

#### State 2: No Adjustment Needed (Gray)
- **Background**: Gray/neutral gradient
- **Badge**: "NO ADJUSTMENT NEEDED" in gray
- **Shows**:
  - Simple confirmation message
- **Example**: "Pitch matches theoretical perfectly"

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
Console logs now provide full visibility:
```
[Physics] Response received: { ...full response... }
[Physics] Pitch calibration info captured: { ...pitch data... }
[Physics] Pitch was adjusted: true/false
[Physics] Parameters saved and visualization updated
```

### 4. Code Changes

**Frontend** (`CalibrationSection3.svelte`):
```svelte
{#if pitchCalibrationInfo}
  {#if pitchCalibrationInfo.was_adjusted}
    <!-- Yellow adjusted state -->
  {:else}
    <!-- Gray not-adjusted state -->
  {/if}
{/if}
```

**Backend** (`calibration.py`):
- Improved logging for pitch extraction
- Added error handling with try/except
- Guaranteed `pitch_calibration_info` in response

### 5. CSS Styling Added
- `.pitch-adjustment-box.pitch-not-adjusted` - Gray variant
- `.status-badge.not-adjusted` - Gray badge styling  
- Responsive and accessible design for both states

## How to Use

1. Open Calibration UI
2. Select **"Physics-Based LED Detection"** mode
3. Adjust any parameter (e.g., Key Gap, White Key Width)
4. Click **"✓ Apply Changes"**
5. Observe pitch calibration box appears with status:
   - **Yellow box** = Pitch was adjusted to match actual LED coverage
   - **Gray box** = Pitch already optimal, no adjustment needed

## Why This is Better

✓ **Always informs user** - No guessing whether pitch calibration ran
✓ **Clear feedback** - Visual distinction between adjusted and not adjusted
✓ **Debugging friendly** - Console logs show all details
✓ **Transparent** - User understands what the system did
✓ **Non-intrusive** - Info box doesn't block workflow
✓ **Locked/read-only** - User can't manually edit pitch (auto-calibrated)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Physics-Based mode shows Advanced Parameters section
- [x] Apply Changes triggers pitch calibration analysis
- [x] Yellow box appears when pitch is adjusted
- [x] Gray box appears when pitch is not adjusted
- [x] Pitch calibration box positioned correctly (in parameters grid)
- [x] Console logs provide debugging info
- [x] Preview Stats removed (as requested)
- [x] No errors or warnings in console

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte`
   - Enhanced savePhysicsParameters() with better logging
   - Added conditional display for both states
   - Added CSS for gray state styling
   - ~200 lines of changes

2. `backend/api/calibration.py`
   - Improved pitch extraction logging
   - Better error handling
   - ~25 lines of changes

3. Removed: `backend/services/led_spacing_calibration.py` (unused code)

## Result

Pitch adjustment is now **automatically applied and displayed** with clear visual feedback showing whether adjustment occurred or was not needed. System is fully transparent about pitch calibration process.
