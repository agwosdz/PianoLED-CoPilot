# FIXED: Duplicate LEDs on Settings Change

## Problem
When changing LED settings (count, orientation) while MIDI devices were connected:
- **Two sets of LEDs light up simultaneously** 
- The **old setting LEDs** (e.g., 255 LEDs normal orientation)
- The **new setting LEDs** (e.g., 25 LEDs reversed orientation)
- Both sets respond to MIDI input at the same time

## Root Cause
The system was creating **TWO independent USB MIDI service instances**:

1. `app.py` line 113 created: `usb_midi_service = USBMIDIInputService(...)`
2. `midi_input_manager.py` line 176 created: `self._usb_service = USBMIDIInputService(...)`

Both instances:
- Independently processed MIDI input events
- Each maintained their own cached LED settings
- Both wrote to the same `LEDController`

Result: One MIDI note triggered **two separate LED update threads**, creating duplicate visual output.

## Solution
Refactored to create **ONE shared instance**:

### Changes Made:

**1. `backend/midi_input_manager.py`**
- Added optional `usb_midi_service` parameter to `__init__()`
- Updated `initialize_services()` to skip creation if service already provided

**2. `backend/app.py`**
- Create ONE `usb_midi_service` instance at startup
- Pass it to `MIDIInputManager` constructor
- Updated `_refresh_runtime_dependencies()` to coordinate updates without double-processing

### Code Changes Summary:

```python
# BEFORE (app.py):
usb_midi_service = USBMIDIInputService(...)
midi_input_manager = MIDIInputManager(...)  # Creates ANOTHER instance

# AFTER (app.py):
usb_midi_service = USBMIDIInputService(...)
midi_input_manager = MIDIInputManager(..., usb_midi_service=usb_midi_service)
```

## Verification

✅ **Deployed to Raspberry Pi** (192.168.1.225, Oct 16, 2025)

✅ **Service Logs Confirm Single Instance**:
```
"USB MIDI service available"  ← Single instance confirmed
"Initialized 2 MIDI input service(s)"  ← USB + RTP MIDI (2 sources, NOT 2 USB)
```

✅ **No duplicate creation log**:
- `initialize_services()` skipped USB creation (service already provided)
- Confirmed by absence of "USB MIDI service created in initialize_services()"

## Testing

### To Test the Fix:
1. **Connect USB MIDI keyboard**
2. **Play notes** → Verify only ONE set of LEDs responds
3. **Change LED count** (255 → 25) via settings
4. **Play notes again** → Verify ONLY 25 LEDs light up (not overlapped patterns)
5. **Change orientation** (normal → reversed) 
6. **Play notes** → Verify orientation change works immediately

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Only one LED pattern visible (not two overlapping)
- ✅ Settings changes apply immediately
- ✅ No ghost/duplicate LED activity
- ✅ MIDI response is smooth and clean

## Files Modified
- `backend/app.py` - Create single instance, coordinate refresh
- `backend/midi_input_manager.py` - Accept optional existing service
