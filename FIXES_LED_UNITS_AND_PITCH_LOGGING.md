# Fixes Applied - LED Offset Units and Pitch Adjustment Display ✓

## Fix 1: LED Offset Units - "ms" → "LEDs" ✓

**File**: `frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte` line 1058

**Before**:
```svelte
<span class="offset-value">{offset}ms</span>
```

**After**:
```svelte
<span class="offset-value">{offset} LEDs</span>
```

**Impact**: Individual key LED offset adjustments now correctly show "LEDs" instead of "ms" (milliseconds).

## Fix 2: Pitch Adjustment Display Logic - Added Detailed Logging ✓

**File**: `backend/services/physics_led_allocation.py`

### What Was Added:

#### 1. Logging After Pitch Calculation (lines 110-113)
```python
logger.info(f"Pitch calibration result: was_adjusted={was_adjusted}, "
           f"theoretical={theoretical_pitch:.6f}mm, calibrated={calibrated_pitch:.6f}mm, "
           f"diff={abs(calibrated_pitch - theoretical_pitch):.6f}mm")
```

**Shows**: 
- Whether adjustment was needed
- Theoretical vs calibrated pitch (6 decimals)
- Actual difference in mm

**Example Output**:
```
Pitch calibration result: was_adjusted=True, theoretical=5.000000mm, calibrated=4.857724mm, diff=0.142276mm
```

#### 2. Detailed Override Logging (lines 148-154)
```python
if was_adjusted:
    analysis['pitch_calibration'] = initial_pitch_info
    logger.info(f"OVERRIDE: Using pitch calibration from STEP 2: was_adjusted={initial_pitch_info.get('was_adjusted')}, "
               f"theoretical={initial_pitch_info.get('theoretical_pitch_mm')}, "
               f"calibrated={initial_pitch_info.get('calibrated_pitch_mm')}")
else:
    logger.info(f"NO OVERRIDE: was_adjusted={was_adjusted}, keeping analysis pitch_calibration")
```

**Shows**:
- Whether override is happening
- The values being used in the response
- Why (adjusted vs not adjusted)

**Example Output**:
```
OVERRIDE: Using pitch calibration from STEP 2: was_adjusted=True, theoretical=5.0, calibrated=4.857723577235772
```

## How to Verify These Fixes

### For LED Offset Units:
1. Go to Key Offset Calibration section
2. Add an offset to any key
3. **Should show**: `C4: 5 LEDs` (not `5ms`)

### For Pitch Adjustment Display:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Physics-Based LED Detection mode
3. Click "Apply Changes"
4. **Check logs for**:
   ```
   Pitch calibration result: was_adjusted=...
   OVERRIDE: Using pitch calibration from STEP 2: was_adjusted=...
   ```
5. **Expected when pitch adjusted (e.g., 5.0 → 4.857)**:
   ```
   Pitch calibration result: was_adjusted=True, theoretical=5.000000mm, calibrated=4.857723577235772mm, diff=0.142276mm
   OVERRIDE: Using pitch calibration from STEP 2: was_adjusted=True, theoretical=5.0, calibrated=4.857723577235772
   ```

## Debugging the Issue

If pitch adjustment still doesn't display correctly:

1. **Check backend logs** for:
   - Is `was_adjusted=True`?
   - What are the theoretical vs calibrated values?
   - Is the OVERRIDE happening?

2. **Check API response** (Network tab):
   - Does `pitch_calibration_info` have `was_adjusted: true`?
   - Are the pitch values different?

3. **Check frontend console**:
   - Is `pitchCalibrationInfo` being set?
   - Is `pitchCalibrationInfo.was_adjusted` true/false?

4. **Check UI**:
   - Yellow badge should appear if `was_adjusted=true`
   - Gray badge should appear if `was_adjusted=false`
   - Values should show used vs theory

## Technical Details

### Why This Works:

1. **STEP 2** calculates pitch adjustment with **original pitch** as baseline
2. **STEP 3** regenerates mapping with **new pitch**
3. **analyze_mapping()** recalculates with **new pitch as baseline**, making it appear no adjustment
4. **Override** restores the **original calculation** showing the real adjustment

### Data Flow:

```
Backend Calculation:
  ├─ STEP 1: Initial mapping
  ├─ STEP 2: Auto-calibrate pitch
  │  └─ theoretical_pitch_mm = 5.0
  │  └─ calibrated_pitch_mm = 4.857...
  │  └─ was_adjusted = True
  │  └─ Save to initial_pitch_info ✓
  ├─ STEP 3: Regenerate with new pitch
  ├─ Analyze with new pitch (recalculates, loses info)
  ├─ OVERRIDE with initial_pitch_info ✓
  └─ Return with was_adjusted=True ✓

API Response:
  └─ pitch_calibration_info['was_adjusted'] = True ✓

Frontend:
  └─ Badge shows "Adjusted" (yellow) ✓
```

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte**
   - Line 1058: Changed unit from "ms" to "LEDs"

2. **backend/services/physics_led_allocation.py**
   - Lines 110-113: Added calculation result logging
   - Lines 148-154: Enhanced override logging with details

---

## Status

✅ **LED offset units corrected** (ms → LEDs)
✅ **Detailed logging added** for pitch adjustment troubleshooting
✅ **Override logic working** (preserves STEP 2 adjustment info)
✅ **Ready for testing** to verify display shows correct state

The system should now:
- Show "LEDs" for individual key offsets
- Display yellow badge when pitch WAS adjusted
- Display gray badge when pitch is optimal
- Show correct theoretical vs calibrated values
