# Debug Analysis: Falling Notes Not Animating

## Current State (from debug output)
```
Time: 0.00s / 0.00s | Playing: false
Notes: Loaded=1320 | Visible=14 | Lookahead=4s
First note: MIDI 65 at 0.00s
Last note: MIDI 58 at 286.00s
First visible: MIDI 65 | timeUntil=0.00s | topPercent=100.0%
```

## Problem Analysis

### What's Working ✅
1. **Notes are loaded**: 1320 MIDI notes successfully fetched from backend
2. **Visibility filter works**: 14 notes are currently visible in the 4-second lookahead window
3. **Positioning formula correct**: First note at topPercent=100% means it's at the keyboard (correct for startTime=0.00s)

### What's NOT Working ❌
1. **Playback not started**: `Playing: false` and `currentTime=0.00s`
2. **Time not advancing**: Without currentTime changing, notes can't fall
3. **Notes appear static**: Since time isn't progressing, positions don't update

## Root Cause

The visualization works correctly, but **the backend playback isn't running**. 

- `currentTime` is stuck at 0.00s
- Without time advancing, notes have no reason to move
- The falling animation is **time-driven**, not update-driven

## Position Formula Verification

For reference, the position formula is:
```
topPercent = (LOOK_AHEAD_TIME - timeUntilNote) / LOOK_AHEAD_TIME * 100
```

Where LOOK_AHEAD_TIME = 4 seconds

**Examples:**
- Note 4 seconds away: `(4 - 4) / 4 * 100 = 0%` (top of screen) ✓
- Note 2 seconds away: `(4 - 2) / 4 * 100 = 50%` (middle) ✓
- Note 0 seconds away: `(4 - 0) / 4 * 100 = 100%` (keyboard) ✓
- Note -1 second ago: `(4 - (-1)) / 4 * 100 = 125%` (below screen) ✓

## First Note Analysis

**First note in file:**
- MIDI note: 65 (F4)
- Start time: 0.00s
- Hand: RIGHT (≥ 54) → Should be YELLOW
- At playback start (time 0):
  - timeUntilNote = 0 - 0 = 0
  - topPercent = 100% (at keyboard)
  - Color: Yellow (#FFD700)

This is correct! The note starts at the keyboard because it plays immediately.

## What Should Happen When Playback Starts

**Timeline after pressing Play:**

| Time | First Note Position | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| -4s | Would be at 0% if shown | Outside window (past) |
| -2s | Would be at 50% if shown | Outside window (past) |
| 0s | At 100% (keyboard) | Currently playing! |
| +2s | Would be at 150% | Below screen (played) |

But since first note starts at 0s, the earliest it appears is at 0s when playback begins.

## Next Notes Should Appear

After first note, there should be 13 other visible notes from the 1320 total.
The next visible notes should be the ones with startTimes between 0-4 seconds.

## Action Items

1. **Start playback** and observe if `currentTime` advances
2. **If currentTime advances:**
   - Visible note count should change as new notes enter window
   - topPercent of first visible note should increase toward 100%
   - Once past 100%, different note should become "first visible"
3. **If currentTime doesn't advance:**
   - Check backend playback service
   - Verify `/api/playback-status` returns correct current_time
   - Debug why playback state is false

## Current Issues to Verify

- [ ] Is playback actually starting when you click Play button?
- [ ] Is backend returning advancing `current_time` values?
- [ ] Are notes appearing on screen (even if static)?
- [ ] What colors are the notes showing? (Should be orange/yellow based on MIDI note)

## Performance Notes

- 1320 notes loaded is reasonable
- Rendering 14 visible notes at a time is excellent (out of 1320)
- No performance issues should occur

## Next Steps

1. Click Play button and watch debug display
2. Report if time advances (currentTime changes)
3. Report if notes become visible on screen
4. Report colors of visible notes
