# Solder Joint Compensation Integration ✓ COMPLETE

## Problem Statement
The user asked: **"Did we incorporate the 1mm addition after led 53 and 154 in the math?"**

Investigation revealed that solder joint compensation existed in `scripts/piano.py` but was **completely missing** from the backend LED placement calculations in `backend/config_led_mapping_physical.py`.

**Impact**: Backend LED placements were potentially off by up to 2mm (1mm × 2 joints for LEDs 154+).

## Solution: Integrated Solder Joint Compensation

### What Are Solder Joints?
Physical gaps created by solder connections in LED strips:
- **Position 1**: After LED 53 (+1.0 mm)
- **Position 2**: After LED 154 (+1.0 mm)
- **Total Maximum Offset**: +2.0 mm for LEDs 155+

### Implementation Details

#### Constants Added to `LEDPhysicalPlacement` Class
```python
# Solder joint compensation constants (matching piano.py)
LED_JOINT_ADDAGE = 1.0  # mm per joint
SOLDER_JOINT_POSITIONS = {53, 154}  # LED indices after which joints create gaps
```

#### Updated Method: `calculate_led_placements()`

**Before** (missing compensation):
```python
led_center = strip_start_mm + (relative_idx * self.led_spacing_mm) + self.led_strip_offset
```

**After** (with compensation):
```python
# Base position without compensation
base_center = strip_start_mm + (relative_idx * self.led_spacing_mm) + self.led_strip_offset

# Apply solder joint compensation
num_joints_before = sum(1 for joint_pos in self.SOLDER_JOINT_POSITIONS if relative_idx > joint_pos)
joint_compensation = num_joints_before * self.LED_JOINT_ADDAGE

# Final position with joint compensation
led_center = base_center + joint_compensation
```

### Key Design Decision: Counting Joints BEFORE Current LED

The compensation counts joints that come **before** the current LED:
- LEDs 0-53: `num_joints_before = 0` (no compensation)
- LEDs 54-154: `num_joints_before = 1` (+1.0 mm compensation)
- LEDs 155+: `num_joints_before = 2` (+2.0 mm compensation)

This matches the `piano.py` implementation exactly:
```python
num_joints_before = sum(1 for joint_pos in SOLDER_JOINT_POSITIONS if led_index > joint_pos)
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/config_led_mapping_physical.py**
   - Added `LED_JOINT_ADDAGE = 1.0` constant to `LEDPhysicalPlacement` class
   - Added `SOLDER_JOINT_POSITIONS = {53, 154}` constant
   - Updated `calculate_led_placements()` docstring to document compensation
   - Implemented joint compensation logic in LED center calculation
   - Verified: ✓ No syntax errors

## Impact on Backend Operations

### LED Placement Calculations
All LED positions calculated via `PhysicalMappingAnalyzer.analyze_mapping()` will now include solder joint compensation:
1. Key geometries calculated (unchanged)
2. **LED placements calculated WITH joint compensation** (UPDATED)
3. Coverage analysis uses compensated LED positions (FIXED)
4. Symmetry scoring uses compensated positions (FIXED)
5. Rescue orphaned LEDs uses compensated positions (FIXED)

### Affected Endpoints
- `POST /api/calibration/allocate-leds` → Allocations now account for joints
- `GET /api/calibration/physics-parameters` → Returns pitch/stats with joint compensation

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Solder joint constants added to backend
- [x] Constants match `piano.py` exactly (positions 53, 154; 1mm compensation)
- [x] Compensation applied in `calculate_led_placements()`
- [x] Logic counts joints BEFORE current LED (correct order)
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] Class docstring updated
- [x] Method docstring updated

## Example: LED Position Calculations

With `led_density=200` (5mm spacing), `led_strip_offset=1.75mm`:

| LED Index | Base Position | Joints Before | Compensation | Final Position |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0         | 1.75 mm       | 0             | 0 mm         | **1.75 mm**     |
| 53        | 267.75 mm     | 0             | 0 mm         | **267.75 mm**   |
| 54        | 271.25 mm     | 1             | 1.0 mm       | **272.25 mm**   |
| 154       | 773.25 mm     | 1             | 1.0 mm       | **774.25 mm**   |
| 155       | 776.75 mm     | 2             | 2.0 mm       | **778.75 mm**   |
