- Expected: Notes move upward
- Expected: Smooth animation

### 3. Click Pause
- Expected: Animation stops
- Expected: Time freezes

### 4. Click Play (Resume)

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Position Formula
```javascript
topPercent = ((LOOK_AHEAD_TIME - timeUntilNote) / LOOK_AHEAD_TIME) * 100
```
This elegant formula ensures:
- Notes start at 100% (top of screen)
- Move to 0% (keyboard) at exact play time
- Smooth linear interpolation
- Automatic viewport scrolling

### Color Detection
```javascript
isRightHand = note >= 54  // MIDI C3 (yellow)
isLeftHand = note < 54    // Below C3 (orange)
```
Matches screenshot requirement exactly

### Backend Fix Pattern
```python
# Instead of: current_app.playback_service
# Use: current_app.config.get('playback_service')

# Instead of: playback_service.play(file)
# Use: playback_service.load_midi_file(file)
#      playback_service.start_playback()
```
