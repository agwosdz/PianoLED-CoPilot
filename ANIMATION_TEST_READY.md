- Verify: "Playing: false"
```

**Step 2: Click Play Button**
```
Expected immediate changes:
- Button changes to "⏸ Pause"
- Debug still shows "Playing: false" (first poll not yet received)
```

**Step 3: Wait 100ms, Take Screenshot #1**
```
Expected:
- Debug now shows "Playing: true"
- Time: 0.10s / 240.39s
- Notes have moved upward slightly
- Progress bar starting to fill
```

**Step 4: Wait 1 second, Take Screenshot #2**
```
Expected:
- Time: 1.00s / 240.39s
- Notes moved upward significantly
- First note now at ~75% from keyboard
- Progress bar ~1% filled
```

**Step 5: Wait 2 seconds, Take Screenshot #3**
```
Expected:
- Time: 2.00s / 240.39s
- Notes moved to middle of viewport

- Time freezes at current value (e.g., 4.56s)
```

**Step 9: Click Play (Resume)**
```
Expected:
- Animation continues from paused position
- Time resumes advancing
- No jumps (smooth transition)
```

**Step 10: Click Stop**
