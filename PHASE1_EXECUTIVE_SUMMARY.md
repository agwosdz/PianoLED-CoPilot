## What It Does

### Analyzes Physical LED Placement
```
For each of 88 piano keys:
â”œâ”€ Calculates exact physical dimensions
â”œâ”€ Finds overlapping LEDs
â”œâ”€ Scores symmetry of alignment
â”œâ”€ Checks LED distribution consistency  
â”œâ”€ Measures overhang amounts
â””â”€ Assigns overall quality label

Returns: Per-key + system metrics
Endpoint: GET /api/calibration/physical-analysis
Response Time: 2-5 seconds
```

### Provides Quality Feedback
```
Per-Key Metrics:
â”œâ”€ Symmetry Score (0.0-1.0): How centered are LEDs?
â”œâ”€ Consistency Score (0.0-1.0): Even distribution?
â”œâ”€ Coverage Amount (mm): How much of key is covered?
â””â”€ Overall Quality: "Excellent" | "Good" | "Acceptable" | "Poor"

System Metrics:
â”œâ”€ Average Symmetry
â”œâ”€ Quality Distribution
â”œâ”€ Excellent/Good/Acceptable/Poor Key Counts
â””â”€ Overall Grade
```

### Supports Parameter Customization
```
GET/POST Parameters:
â”œâ”€ leds_per_meter (LED density)
â”œâ”€ led_physical_width (mm)
â”œâ”€ led_strip_offset (mm)
â”œâ”€ overhang_threshold (mm)
â”œâ”€ white_key_width (mm)
â”œâ”€ black_key_width (mm)
â”œâ”€ white_key_gap (mm)
â””â”€ start_led / end_led

Analyzes proposed settings WITHOUT applying them!

## API Usage Examples

### Get Current Analysis
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/physical-analysis | jq .
```

### Test Proposed Settings (No Changes)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/physical-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  fetch('/api/calibration/physical-analysis')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(`Overall Quality: ${data.overall_quality}`);
      console.log(`Avg Symmetry: ${(data.quality_metrics.avg_symmetry * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
    });
}, []);
```

## What Happens Next

### Option A: Deploy Now âœ… RECOMMENDED
1. Deploy to Pi
2. Verify endpoint works
3. Analyze current setup
4. Decide on Phase 2 later

### Option B: Phase 2 Later (Optional)
Replace current algorithm with physics-based LED detection
- Estimated time: 1-2 weeks
- Risk level: Medium
- Potential accuracy improvement

### Option C: Phase 3 Later (Optional)  
Add UI integration and visualization
- Estimated time: 2-3 weeks
- Risk level: Low
- Much better UX

---

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk: **LOW** âœ…

**Why So Safe:**
- Additive changes only (no existing code removed)
- Feature disabled by default
- Doesn't affect LED control
- Can be disabled at runtime
- Database migration-safe
- Full backward compatibility
- Comprehensive tests

**Worst Case:** Disable feature flag, system works exactly as before

---

## Performance Impact

**Analysis Time:** 2-5 seconds (one-time per request)
**Memory:** 5-10MB for analyzer + data
**API Response:** ~500KB JSON
**Impact on LEDs:** Zero (analysis is separate)
**Real-Time Performance:** No impact (analysis is optional)
