- Simplified calibration section
```

### ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Unified Interface**
   - Add timing offset and LED allocation in one form
   - No context switching between panels

2. **Optional LED Customization**
   - Checkbox to enable/disable LED grid
   - Use offset without LEDs or vice versa
   - Pre-populate existing LED overrides

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Real-time LED counter
   - Selection checkmarks
   - LED override badges in list
   - Hover effects and transitions

4. **Atomic Operations**
   - Offset and LED override saved together
   - Both succeed or both fail
   - Consistent state maintained

5. **Backward Compatible**
   - No data migration needed
   - Existing offsets and overrides work
   - Can add either or both to keys

### üß™ Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Add offset only
```
1. MIDI Note: 60
2. Offset: 2
3. Skip LED customization
4. Click Add
‚úì Result: Displays "C4 | 2 LEDs offset"
```

#### Scenario 2: Add offset with LEDs
```
1. MIDI Note: 60
2. Offset: 2
3. Check "Customize LED allocation"
4. Select LEDs 120, 121, 122
5. Click Add
‚úì Result: Displays offset + LED badge
```

#### Scenario 3: Add LEDs only
```
1. MIDI Note: 60
2. Offset: 0
3. Check "Customize LED allocation"
4. Select LEDs 120, 121, 122
5. Click Add
‚úì Result: Displays "0 LEDs offset" + LED badge
```

#### Scenario 4: Edit existing
```
1. Click Edit on existing adjustment
2. Update offset value
3. Click Save
‚úì Result: Offset updated, LEDs unchanged
```

#### Scenario 5: Delete adjustment
```
1. Click Delete
2. Confirm deletion
‚úì Result: Both offset and LED override removed
```

### üéØ Summary

LED Selection Override has been successfully merged into Individual Key Offsets, creating a unified "Per-Key Adjustments" interface. Users can now adjust both timing and LED allocation for each piano key from a single form. The implementation is clean, maintains backward compatibility, and improves the overall user experience.

**Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING
