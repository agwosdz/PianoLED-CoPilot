## Implementation Details

### File Modified: `backend/playback_service.py`

#### Method: `_check_learning_mode_pause()` (Lines 882-981)

**4-Stage Process**:

```
STAGE 1: RECOGNIZE ✓
├─ Check if all expected notes played within timing window
├─ Detect any wrong notes
└─ Status: "All required notes satisfied"

        ↓

STAGE 2: DISPLAY ✓
├─ Call _highlight_expected_notes() with bright colors
├─ All LEDs show 100% brightness
└─ Visual confirmation of success

        ↓

STAGE 3: CLEAR ✓
├─ Create set of satisfied notes (expected_left | expected_right)
├─ Rebuild left_hand_notes_queue filtering out satisfied notes
├─ Rebuild right_hand_notes_queue filtering out satisfied notes
└─ Log remaining queue sizes

        ↓

STAGE 4: PROCEED ✓
├─ Return False (stop pausing)
├─ Playback loop continues
├─ Current time advances naturally
└─ Next measure's notes begin
```

### Key Code Segment (Lines 967-990)

```python
# If all required notes are satisfied: clear them and proceed
if all_satisfied and (expected_left_notes or expected_right_notes):
    logger.info(f"Learning mode: ✓ All required notes satisfied at {self._current_time:.2f}s. "
               f"Left: {sorted(expected_left_notes)}, Right: {sorted(expected_right_notes)}")
    
    # STAGE 2: Show satisfied notes on LEDs (bright colors)
    self._highlight_expected_notes(expected_left_notes, expected_right_notes,
                                  played_left_notes, played_right_notes)
    
    # STAGE 3: CLEAR PRESSED KEYS
    notes_to_clear = expected_left_notes | expected_right_notes
    
    self._left_hand_notes_queue = deque(
        (note, ts) for note, ts in self._left_hand_notes_queue
        if note not in notes_to_clear
    )
    self._right_hand_notes_queue = deque(
        (note, ts) for note, ts in self._right_hand_notes_queue
        if note not in notes_to_clear
    )
    
    logger.info(f"Learning mode: Cleared satisfied notes from queues. "
               f"Remaining left queue: {len(self._left_hand_notes_queue)}, "
               f"Remaining right queue: {len(self._right_hand_notes_queue)}")
    
    # STAGE 4: PROCEED TO PLAYBACK
    return False  # Stop pausing, allow playback to continue
```

## Data Flow

### Queue Lifecycle for One Measure

```
[MEASURE 1 STARTS]
├─ Expected notes: C=60, D=62 (left); G=67, A=69 (right)
├─ Pause active, LEDs show DIM colors
│
├─ User plays C → Added to left_queue as (60, 12.345)
│  └─ LED for C brightens to 100%
│
├─ User plays D → Added to left_queue as (62, 12.501)
│  └─ LED for D brightens to 100%
│
├─ User plays G → Added to right_queue as (67, 12.402)
│  └─ LED for G brightens to 100%
│
├─ User plays A → Added to right_queue as (69, 12.599)
│  └─ LED for A brightens to 100%
│
├─ CHECK: All expected satisfied? YES ✓
│
├─ DISPLAY: Show all LEDs bright (confirmation)
│
├─ CLEAR: Remove from queues
│  ├─ left_queue = [(60, 12.345), (62, 12.501)] → REMOVE → []
│  └─ right_queue = [(67, 12.402), (69, 12.599)] → REMOVE → []
│
├─ PROCEED: Return False (unpause)
│
└─ [MEASURE 2 STARTS WITH CLEAN STATE]
   ├─ Queues empty: []
   ├─ New expected notes loaded
   ├─ Pause for new measure
   └─ Cycle repeats
```

### Queue State Examples

**Before Clearing**:
```
left_queue:  [(60, t1), (62, t2), (64, t3)]  ← 64 is extra/wrong note
right_queue: [(67, t4), (69, t5)]
```

**After Clearing** (removed 60, 62, 67, 69):
```
left_queue:  [(64, t3)]  ← Extra note remains (wasn't expected)
right_queue: []
```

**Next Measure**:
```
Expected: C, D, E (65) for left; G, A for right
Played in window: 
├─ left_queue has: (64, t3) from previous measure + new plays
├─ right_queue has: new plays
└─ Comparison now correct (old satisfied notes gone!)
```

## LED Behavior Timeline

### User Perspective

```
TIME 0:00 - START MEASURE 1
├─ Song loads with learning mode enabled
├─ Playback PAUSES immediately
├─ LEDs show expected notes in DIM colors
│  ├─ Left hand: Coral red (50% brightness)
│  └─ Right hand: Dark blue (50% brightness)
└─ [WAITING: Play the shown notes]

TIME 0:05 - USER PLAYS FIRST NOTE
├─ Your played note recognized
├─ That LED BRIGHTENS to 100%
└─ [WAITING: Play remaining notes]

TIME 0:10 - USER PLAYS ALL REQUIRED NOTES
├─ All expected LEDs now BRIGHT (100%)
├─ ALL LEDS FLASH/DISPLAY SATISFACTION
├─ Automatic clearing happens (invisible)
├─ Playback ADVANCES to next measure
└─ [NEXT MEASURE READY]

TIME 0:15 - MEASURE 2 STARTS
├─ New expected notes shown in DIM colors
├─ Fresh slate (old notes cleared from memory)
└─ [WAITING: Play the new notes]

[PATTERN REPEATS FOR EACH MEASURE]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Quick Verification (2 minutes)
```bash
1. Start backend: python -m backend.app
2. Load 1-measure MIDI file
3. Enable learning mode
4. Play the required notes
5. Observe:
   ✓ Pause happens
   ✓ LEDs show expected notes
   ✓ LEDs brighten as you play
   ✓ Playback auto-advances
```

### Comprehensive Testing (10 minutes)
```bash
1. Load 5-measure piece
2. Play through entire piece without touching playback controls
3. Verify:
   ✓ Each measure pauses initially
   ✓ LEDs show correct colors (coral/blue)
   ✓ Playback advances automatically
   ✓ No notes carry over between measures
   ✓ Logs show clearing and progression
```

### Edge Cases (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Single-hand measures (left only or right only)
2. Many-note chords (8+ notes)
3. Wrong notes during playback
4. Quick consecutive measures
```

## Expected Log Output

### Successful Progression (What to look for)
```
INFO [14:23:45.123] Learning mode: ✓ All required notes satisfied at 5.23s. Left: [60, 62, 65], Right: [72, 76]
INFO [14:23:45.124] Learning mode: Cleared satisfied notes from queues. Remaining left queue: 0, Remaining right queue: 0
DEBUG [14:23:45.125] Learning mode pausing at 6.50s
INFO [14:23:46.200] Learning mode: ✓ All required notes satisfied at 6.50s. Left: [64, 67], Right: [71, 79]
INFO [14:23:46.201] Learning mode: Cleared satisfied notes from queues. Remaining left queue: 0, Remaining right queue: 0
```

### Key Indicators
- ✓ Checkmark symbol (`✓`) = all notes satisfied
- ✓ "Cleared satisfied notes" = queue clearing happened
- ✓ "Remaining queue: 0" = clean state for next measure
- ✓ Successive satisfaction messages = auto-progression working

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing
- **Queue clearing**: < 1ms per operation
- **Frequency**: Once per satisfied measure (every ~2-4 seconds)
- **Playback overhead**: Negligible (< 0.1% CPU)

### Memory
- **Queue size**: Typically 5-20 notes (< 1KB)
- **Cleared per measure**: Typically 4-8 notes removed
- **Auto-cleanup**: Runs every 1 second, removes notes > 5 seconds old
- **Total impact**: Bounded, efficient

---

## Integration Architecture

### Playback Loop Flow
```
_playback_loop() runs continuously
    ↓
Check if pause_event set → Continue loop (natural pause)
    ↓
Check learning mode → _check_learning_mode_pause()
    ├─ Returns True (should pause)
    │  └─ Loop sleeps and continues (playback paused)
    └─ Returns False (should proceed)
       └─ Loop continues, playback advances
```

### Note Recording Flow
```
USB/rtpMIDI Input
    ↓
midi_input_manager._update_active_notes()
    ↓
playback_service.record_midi_note_played(note)
    ↓
Timestamp recorded: (note, time.time())
    ↓
Added to left_hand_notes_queue or right_hand_notes_queue
    ↓
_check_learning_mode_pause() uses this data
```

### LED Feedback Flow
```
_check_learning_mode_pause() determines status
    ├─ Wrong notes → _highlight_wrong_notes() → RED
    ├─ Waiting → _highlight_expected_notes() → DIM COLORS
    └─ Satisfied → _highlight_expected_notes() → BRIGHT COLORS
    
    Then clearing happens, then playback continues
```
