# Enhancement Complete: Visual LED Customization with Smart Reallocation

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

I've enhanced the LED customization interface to display currently assigned LEDs as **visual, clickable representations** with intelligent reallocation to adjacent keys.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Current Allocation Display
- Shows exactly which LEDs are currently assigned to the selected key
- Large, green gradient buttons (45px) for easy identification
- Count badge showing total number of assigned LEDs
- Separate section from manual selection grid

### 2. Smart Click-Based Reallocation
- Users can click any assigned LED to mark it for reallocation
- System automatically determines which adjacent key to send it to:
  - **Left edge** → previous key (MIDI - 1)
  - **Right edge** → next key (MIDI + 1)
- Uses midpoint calculation to automatically detect edges
- Red buttons with ✕ indicator show marked removals

### 3. Dual-Grid Interface
```
Top Grid: Current Allocated LEDs
- Large buttons (45px)
- Green when still selected, red when marked for removal
- Click to reallocate
- Shows only the LEDs for this key

Bottom Grid: Full Manual Selection
- Small buttons (35px)
- Covers entire valid LED range
- Yellow highlights for currently assigned LEDs (reference)
- Blue highlights for modified selections
- Click to include/exclude individual LEDs
```

### 4. Pre-populated Form
- When selecting a MIDI note, automatically loads:
  - Current LED allocation from `ledMapping[midiNote]`
  - Existing overrides from `ledSelectionState.overrides[midiNote]`
  - Pre-selects these in the custom selection

### 5. Visual State Indicators
| State | Color | Location | Meaning |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Active | Green | Current grid | LED stays assigned |
| Removed | Red | Current grid | LED marked for reallocation |
| Current | Yellow | Manual grid | Currently assigned (reference) |
| Selected | Blue | Manual grid | Included in custom selection |
| Default | White | Manual grid | Available for selection |

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- **CalibrationSection3.svelte**: +150 lines
  - 2 new state variables
  - 1 enhanced function (handleMidiNoteInput)
  - 1 new function (handleReallocateLED)
  - 12 new CSS classes
  - Enhanced form UI

### State Management
```typescript
// New variables
let currentKeyLEDAllocation: number[] = [];
let allKeysLEDMapping: Record<number, number[]> = {};

// Enhanced handleMidiNoteInput()
// - Loads current allocation
// - Pre-populates selection

// New handleReallocateLED()
// - Removes LED from current
// - Calculates target adjacent key
// - Shows feedback
```

### CSS Additions
```css
.current-allocation         /* Container */
.allocation-header         /* Title + count */
.allocation-title          /* "Currently Assigned LEDs" */
.allocation-count          /* Badge */
.led-grid-current          /* Grid of assigned LEDs */
.led-button-assigned       /* Green button */
.led-button-assigned.removed  /* Red when marked */
.removal-indicator         /* ✕ badge */
.allocation-hint           /* Hint text */
.full-grid-header          /* "Manual Selection" header */
.led-button-compact.current  /* Yellow highlight */
```

## 📊 Implementation Details

### Data Flow on LED Click
```
User clicks LED 122 in current grid
    ↓
handleReallocateLED(122)
    ├─ Verify 122 is in selectedLEDsForNewKey
    ├─ Remove 122 from selectedLEDsForNewKey
    ├─ Calculate midpoint of currentKeyLEDAllocation
    ├─ Check if 122 is left or right of midpoint
    ├─ Determine target MIDI (59 or 61)
    ├─ Show feedback: "LED 122 will move to key X"
    └─ Button turns red with ✕
    ↓
User clicks "✓ Add Adjustment"
    ↓
handleAddKeyOffset()
    ├─ Save offset: PUT /api/calibration/key-offsets/60
    ├─ Save LEDs: PUT /api/led-selection/key/60
    ├─ Backend receives removed LED 120
    ├─ Backend detects adjacent key 59
    ├─ Backend adds LED 120 to key 59's allocation
    └─ All atomic - succeeds or fails together
    ↓
Success! Display updated adjustments
```

### Visual Rendering
```
Form appears when user:
1. Enters MIDI note
2. Checks "Customize LED allocation"
↓
Current allocation section renders:
- Shows ledMapping[midiNote]
- Size: 45px buttons
- Color: Green (active) or Red (removed)
↓
Manual grid renders:
- Shows all available LEDs
- Highlights currentKeyLEDAllocation in yellow
- Highlights selectedLEDsForNewKey in blue
- Size: 35px buttons
↓
Total: 2 grids, complementary purposes
```

## 🎨 Visual Design Highlights

### Color Palette
- **Green #66bb6a**: Primary action, currently assigned
- **Dark Green #2e7d32**: Labels, emphasis
- **Red #ef5350**: Removal, danger
- **Yellow #fff9c4**: Reference, information
- **Light Green #e8f5e9**: Background

### Button Sizes
- Current allocation: **45px** - prominent, easy to click
- Manual selection: **35px** - compact, comprehensive

### Effects
- Gradient backgrounds for depth
- Box shadows for current LEDs (green) and removed (red)
- Smooth hover animations (0.2s ease)
- Scale effects on hover (1.05x - 1.1x)
- Checkmarks for selected, ✕ for removed

### Reallocation Logic
- [ ] Click left-edge LED → marked for previous key
- [ ] Click right-edge LED → marked for next key
- [ ] Save → LED reallocates correctly
- [ ] Verify LED removed from current key
