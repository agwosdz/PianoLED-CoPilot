# Mapping Reload on Adjustment Changes - Implementation

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Change Summary

Ensured that the LED mapping is reloaded whenever per-key adjustments are added or deleted.

## What Changed

### File: frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte

#### 1. Delete Handler (handleDeleteKeyOffset)
**Before:**
```svelte
async function handleDeleteKeyOffset(midiNote: number) {
  if (confirm(`Delete offset for ${getMidiNoteName(midiNote)}?`)) {
    await deleteKeyOffset(midiNote);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```svelte
async function handleDeleteKeyOffset(midiNote: number) {
  if (confirm(`Delete offset for ${getMidiNoteName(midiNote)}?`)) {
    await deleteKeyOffset(midiNote);
    
    // Reload the LED mapping to reflect the deletion
    await updateLedMapping();
    
    calibrationUI.update(ui => ({ ...ui, success: `Key adjustment deleted for ${getMidiNoteName(midiNote)}` }));
    setTimeout(() => {
      calibrationUI.update(ui => ({ ...ui, success: null }));
    }, 2000);
  }
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Call `updateLedMapping()` after deletion
- ✅ Add success message feedback
- ✅ Match pattern used in add handler

#### 2. Add Handler (handleAddKeyOffset)
**Status:** ✅ Already had mapping reload

```svelte
async function handleAddKeyOffset() {
  // ... validation and trim calculation ...
  
  await setKeyOffset(midiNote, newKeyOffset, leftTrim, rightTrim);
  
  // Reload the LED mapping to reflect the new adjustments
  await updateLedMapping();  // ✅ Already present
  
  // ... success handling ...
}
```

## How It Works

### When Adding an Adjustment
```
User saves adjustment
  ↓
Frontend: Call setKeyOffset()
  ↓
Backend: Stores offset + trim
  ↓
Frontend: Call updateLedMapping() ✅ (Already implemented)
  ↓
Backend: Generate mapping with new adjustment applied
  ↓
Frontend: Update ledMapping store with new values
  ↓
Display: Shows updated LED allocation for the key
```

### When Deleting an Adjustment
```
User confirms deletion
  ↓
Frontend: Call deleteKeyOffset()
  ↓
Backend: Remove offset + trim from database
  ↓
Frontend: Call updateLedMapping() ✅ (NOW ADDED)
  ↓
Backend: Generate mapping without deleted adjustment
  ↓
Frontend: Update ledMapping store with restored values
  ↓
Display: Shows original LED allocation for the key
```

## Behavior Changes

### Add Adjustment
- **Before:** Mapping reloaded ✅
- **After:** Mapping reloaded ✅ (No change)
- **Result:** Correct LED allocation displayed immediately

### Delete Adjustment
- **Before:** Mapping NOT reloaded ❌
- **After:** Mapping reloaded ✅
- **Result:** Correct LED allocation displayed immediately after deletion

## User Experience Impact

### Before
```
1. User deletes adjustment for key 50
2. Adjustment removed from list ✓
3. Backend restores key 50 to base allocation
4. BUT: Frontend mapping not updated ❌
5. Display shows old custom allocation
6. Mismatch between UI and backend
```

### After
```
1. User deletes adjustment for key 50
2. Adjustment removed from list ✓
3. Backend restores key 50 to base allocation
4. Frontend mapping reloaded ✅
5. Display shows correct base allocation
6. Everything matches ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add adjustment to a key
  - Expected: LED allocation updates immediately
- [ ] Verify mapping shows trimmed range if trim was applied
- [ ] Delete the adjustment
  - Expected: LED allocation reverts to base allocation immediately
- [ ] Verify mapping displays original full range
- [ ] Check success message displays for both add and delete
- [ ] Verify no errors in console after delete

## Code Quality

### Consistency
- ✅ Both add and delete handlers now follow same pattern
- ✅ Both call updateLedMapping()
- ✅ Both provide success feedback to user

### Error Handling
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before delete
- ✅ Success message on completion
- ✅ Timeout clears message after 2 seconds

## Related Code

### updateLedMapping() Function
Located in calibration.ts:
```typescript
export async function updateLedMapping() {
  // Fetch latest mapping from backend
  // Update calibrationState.ledMapping store
  // Triggers UI reactivity
}
```

### Handler Pattern
Both handlers now follow:
```
1. Perform action (save/delete)
2. Reload mapping
3. Show feedback to user
4. Clear feedback after timeout
```

## Files Modified

| File | Line | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| CalibrationSection3.svelte | 215-227 | Add updateLedMapping() to delete handler |

## Verification

Run this test sequence:
```bash
1. Add offset: MIDI 50, offset=+2, trim L1/R0
   → Verify adjusted range shows in mapping
   
2. Delete that adjustment
   → Verify adjusted range reverts to base allocation
   → Verify mapping updated immediately (not stale)
   
3. Add offset: MIDI 60, offset=-1, trim L0/R1
   → Verify mapping shows trimmed allocation
   
4. Delete
   → Verify reverts correctly
```

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

Both add and delete operations now properly reload the LED mapping, ensuring the frontend display stays in sync with the backend state.
