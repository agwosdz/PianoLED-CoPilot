# 🔧 Fix: Duplicate Method Error - `_left_hand_notes_played`

## Problem Found
Your logs were showing:
```
ERROR - ERROR recording MIDI note for learning mode: 'PlaybackService' object has no attribute '_left_hand_notes_played'
```

This error appeared repeatedly whenever MIDI notes were played during learning mode.

## Root Cause
**Duplicate method definition in `backend/playback_service.py`:**

1. **Line 852**: NEW version (correct)
   - Uses: `self._left_hand_notes_queue` (deque)
   - Stores: `(note, playback_time)` tuples
   - Uses: **playback time** (seconds into song)

2. **Line 1058**: OLD version (incorrect - was shadowing the new one)
   - Uses: `self._left_hand_notes_played` (set) ❌ **DOESN'T EXIST**
   - Old approach that was replaced

Python was finding the OLD definition first (line 1058), which tried to access a variable that was never created (`_left_hand_notes_played`).

## Solution Applied
✅ **Removed the duplicate old method** at line 1058

Now only one clean `record_midi_note_played()` method exists at line 852 with:
- Proper timestamped queue storage
- Correct use of playback time
- Enhanced logging with 🎵 symbol
- Queue state visibility

## Testing
- Backend started successfully
- No more attribute errors expected
- MIDI notes should now be recorded correctly in learning mode

## Next Steps
Run your backend again and check logs:
```
tail -f backend/logs/playback.log | grep -E "🎵|📊"
```

You should now see:
- 🎵 messages when notes are recorded
- 📊 messages showing expected vs played notes
- Queue sizes growing/shrinking properly
