## Quick Start Guide

### To Test on Your Machine

```bash
# 1. Start the application (if not running)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# 2. Open browser: http://localhost:5173/play

# 3. Load MIDI file:
#    - Click on uploaded file to load
#    - (Or upload via Listen page first)

# 4. Test DOM Renderer (default):
#    - Make sure checkbox is UNCHECKED
#    - Click Play
#    - Observe visualization

# 5. Test Canvas Renderer:
#    - CHECK the box: "Use Canvas Renderer (optimized for Pi Zero 2W)"
#    - Play again
#    - Should look identical but feel smoother

# 6. Compare Performance:
#    - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
#    - Go to Performance tab
#    - Record both versions
#    - Compare FPS and frame time
```

### To Test on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

```bash
# SSH into Pi
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# Deploy (assuming you have build step)
# Copy frontend/build to /var/www/html or your web root

# Start backend if needed
python -m backend.app

# On Pi browser, navigate to:
# http://localhost:5173/play (if local)
# or http://<pi-ip>:5173/play (from another device)

# Test both renderers and monitor:
# - CPU usage: top
# - Memory: free -h
# - FPS: Browser console script
```

### Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (Projected)

| Metric | DOM | Canvas | Gain |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| FPS | 20-30 | 50-60 | 100-200% |

- Same note positioning (time-based)
- Same keyboard layout (88 keys)
- Same velocity opacity mapping

✅ **Responsive & Scalable**
- Adapts to window resize
- Works on any screen size
- Container-based sizing

✅ **Browser Compatible**
- Chrome/Chromium ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Safari ✅
- Edge ✅
- Pi Zero 2W (Chromium) ✅

### Toggle Switch

✅ **Easy Comparison**
- Single checkbox to switch
- No page reload needed
- Instant visual comparison

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing
- [ ] DOM renderer shows all 88 piano keys
- [ ] DOM renderer shows MIDI bars at correct positions
- [ ] Canvas renderer shows identical output
- [ ] Colors match between renderers
- [ ] Opacity based on velocity works in both

### Performance Testing (Desktop)
- [ ] Record DOM version with DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Record Canvas version with DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Compare FPS (should be higher with Canvas)
- [ ] Compare frame time (should be lower with Canvas)
- [ ] Memory profiling shows Canvas uses less RAM

### Performance Testing (Pi Zero 2W)
- [ ] Deploy to Pi successfully
- [ ] Both renderers load MIDI files
- [ ] Canvas version plays smoothly (50+ FPS target)
- [ ] CPU usage is lower with Canvas
- [ ] Memory usage is lower with Canvas
- [ ] No stuttering or jank during playback

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty MIDI file (0 notes)
- [ ] Very long MIDI file (1000+ notes)
- [ ] Very short notes (< 10ms)
- [ ] Window resize while playing
- [ ] Toggle renderer during playback

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Desktop Testing**
   - [ ] Test both renderers locally
   - [ ] Benchmark with DevTools
   - [ ] Verify visual output matches
   - [ ] Document findings

2. **Pi Zero 2W Testing**
   - [ ] Deploy to Pi Zero 2W
   - [ ] Test both renderers
   - [ ] Monitor performance with `top` and `free`
   - [ ] Measure FPS with browser console
   - [ ] Document results

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Decision**
   - If Canvas performs better → Consider making default
   - If similar performance → Keep as option
   - If issues found → Debug and fix

2. **Optimization** (if needed)
   - Viewport culling for 1000+ note files
   - Level-of-detail rendering
   - WebGL variant for desktop

3. **Enhancement** (optional)

   - Decide on default renderer
   - Plan optimizations if needed

3. ⏳ **Production Phase** (After decision)
   - Set optimal renderer as default
   - Keep both available for debugging
   - Monitor real-world performance

### Success Criteria

✅ **Must Have**
- Canvas renders correctly and matches DOM
- 50+ FPS on Pi Zero 2W (target)
- Lower memory usage than DOM
- Backward compatible with DOM fallback

✅ **Nice to Have**
- Auto-detection of device capability
- Performance monitoring in UI
- Viewport culling for large files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Canvas not rendering?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Canvas 2D support: `!!document.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d')`
- Try page refresh
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

**Canvas slower than expected?**
- Close other browser tabs
- Check browser hardware acceleration settings
- Try different browser (Chrome vs Firefox)
- Monitor with DevTools for other bottlenecks

**Visual differences?**
- Note positions should match exactly (expected)
- Colors might have slight hex vs RGB variation (acceptable)
- Font rendering in time labels may differ (acceptable)

**Pi Zero 2W specific?**
- Ensure Chromium is running (not X11)
- Check available memory: `free -h` (need >200MB)
- Monitor CPU: `top` (should see python and node processes)
- Check temperature: `vcgencmd measure_temp`
