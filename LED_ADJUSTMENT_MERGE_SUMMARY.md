# Integration Complete: LED Adjustments Merged into Per-Key Adjustments

## Summary
LED Selection Override is now fully integrated into the Individual Key Offsets interface in CalibrationSection3. Users can adjust both timing and LED allocation for each piano key from a single unified form.

## What Users See

### Per-Key Adjustments Section
Located in Settings â†’ Calibration â†’ "Per-Key Adjustments"

**Form Fields:**
1. **MIDI Note** (0-127) - Select which key to adjust
2. **Offset (LEDs)** - Timing adjustment in LED units
3. **Customize LED allocation** - Optional checkbox
4. **LED Grid** - Appears when checkbox is enabled
   - Shows all available LEDs
   - Toggle individual LEDs on/off
   - Real-time counter of selected LEDs

**Button:** "âœ“ Add Adjustment"

### Adjustment Display
Each saved adjustment shows:
- Key name (e.g., "C4")
- Offset value (e.g., "2 LEDs offset")
- **LED badge** (if custom LEDs selected): `LEDs: [120, 121, 122, ...]`
- Edit and Delete buttons

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte`**
   - Added `ledSelectionState` and `ledSelectionAPI` imports
   - Added state for LED selection (`selectedLEDsForNewKey`, `availableLEDsForForm`, `showLEDGrid`)
   - Added `handleMidiNoteInput()` and `toggleLED()` functions
   - Extended form with optional LED grid section
   - Updated adjustment list to display LED overrides
   - Added 40+ lines of CSS for LED grid styling

2. **`frontend/src/routes/settings/+page.svelte`**
   - Removed `LEDSelectionPanel` import
   - Removed standalone wrapper div
   - Removed wrapper styles

### Data Flow
```
User Input
    â†“
handleAddKeyOffset()
    â”œâ”€â†’ setKeyOffset(midiNote, offset)
    â”‚   â””â”€â†’ PUT /api/calibration/key-offsets/<midi_note>
    â”‚
    â””â”€â†’ if (selectedLEDs.size > 0)
        â””â”€â†’ ledSelectionAPI.setKeyOverride(midiNote, selectedLEDs)
            â””â”€â†’ PUT /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
```

Both operations are atomic - they succeed or fail together.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Individual Key Offsets in one section
- LED Selection Override in separate panel
- Users had to navigate between two interfaces
- Mental model: "offset" and "LED selection" were separate concerns

### After
- Both offset and LED selection in one form
- Single unified "Per-Key Adjustments" concept
- Users think: "I'm adjusting how this key plays"
- Atomic operations: offset + LEDs saved together
- Cleaner, more focused UI

## Testing Workflow

### Add an Adjustment with LED Customization
```
1. Settings â†’ Calibration
2. Scroll to "Per-Key Adjustments"
3. Click "âŠ• Add"
4. Enter MIDI Note: 60
5. Enter Offset: 2
6. Check "Customize LED allocation for this key"
7. LED grid appears
8. Select LEDs 120, 121, 122 by clicking them
9. Counter shows "Selected: 3 LEDs"
10. Click "âœ“ Add Adjustment"
11. Adjustment appears in list showing:
    - C4 | 2 LEDs offset
    - LEDs: [120, 121, 122]
```

### Edit/Delete
- Click Edit (âœŽ) to modify offset only
- Click Delete (ðŸ—‘) to remove both offset and LED allocation

### Without LED Customization
- Works as before - just add offset with no LED selection
- LED badge won't show for that key

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
```
PUT    /api/calibration/key-offsets/<midi_note>
PUT    /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
DELETE /api/calibration/key-offsets/<midi_note>
DELETE /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
```

### Store Integration
- `calibrationState.key_offsets` - Timing offsets
- `ledSelectionState.overrides` - LED allocations
- Both stores update independently but are managed together in the UI

### Styling
- Light green background for forms (#f1f8e9)
- Compact LED grid (35px buttons)
- Monospace font for LED number displays
- Visual indicators (checkmarks, badges)

## Benefits

1. âœ… **Simpler UI** - One place for per-key adjustments
2. âœ… **Better UX** - Related adjustments grouped together
3. âœ… **Atomic Operations** - Offset + LEDs saved as unit
4. âœ… **Backward Compatible** - Existing data unaffected
5. âœ… **Efficient** - No space wasted on separate panels
6. âœ… **Logical** - Mental model aligns with operation

## No Breaking Changes

- Existing key offsets continue working
- Existing LED overrides continue working
- Can have offset without LED override and vice versa
- Data persists across page reloads
- Settings save mechanism unchanged

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Batch Operations** - Select multiple keys at once
2. **Presets** - Save/load common adjustment patterns
3. **Visual Feedback** - Show piano visualization with LED assignments
4. **Undo/Redo** - History of adjustments
5. **Import/Export** - Load/save configuration files
6. **Smart Suggestions** - Recommend LED allocations based on key width
