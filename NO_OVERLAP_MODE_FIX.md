# No-Overlap LED Distribution Mode Fix

## Problem Statement

The "Piano Based (no overlap)" distribution mode was incorrectly showing **87 shared LEDs** between keys, despite `allow_led_sharing=false`. This meant the "no overlap" mode was not actually preventing LED sharing.

### Evidence (Before Fix)

```
Total keys: 88
LEDs with overlap (shared by multiple keys): 87
LED 7: keys [0, 1]
LED 10: keys [1, 2]
LED 13: keys [2, 3]
...
```

## Root Cause

The algorithm was calculating overlapping LED ranges for each key based on continuous position mapping, but it wasn't actually enforcing strict partitioning. The issue was in `backend/config_led_mapping_advanced.py`:

**Problematic Code:**
```python
if allow_led_sharing:
    # Include LEDs that span key's region (with neighbors)
    for led_offset in range(first_led - 1, last_led + 2):
        # Add LED to this key
else:
    # Still included overlapping LEDs!
    for led_offset in range(first_led, last_led + 1):
        # Still natural overlap from position calculation
```

Both modes were calculating overlapping ranges. The `allow_led_sharing=false` branch just didn't expand the range as much, but overlaps still occurred.

## Solution

Implemented **strict LED partitioning** for no-overlap mode:

1. **Pre-allocate all LEDs to keys** based on LED midpoint position
2. **Each LED belongs to exactly one key** (first-come-first-served)
3. **No LED can be assigned twice**

**New Algorithm:**
```python
if not allow_led_sharing:
    # Create LED-to-key assignment first
    led_to_key = {}
    
    for key_idx in range(total_keys):
        for led_offset in range(start_led - start_led, end_led - start_led + 1):
            if led_idx not in led_to_key:  # Only assign if not already assigned
                # Check if LED's midpoint falls within this key's range
                if key_start_mm <= led_midpoint_mm < key_end_mm:
                    led_to_key[led_idx] = key_idx  # Assign once
    
    # Build key-to-LED mapping from the assignment
    for led_idx, key_idx in led_to_key.items():
        key_led_mapping[key_idx].append(led_idx)
```

## Results After Fix

### No-Overlap Mode
```
Total keys: 88
Total unique LEDs used: 245
LEDs with overlap: 0  ✅
Avg LEDs per key: 2.79
Min/Max LEDs per key: 2/3

Key 0: [5, 6, 7]
Key 1: [8, 9, 10]
Key 2: [11, 12, 13]
...
Key 87: [248, 249]
```

### With-Overlap Mode (Unchanged, Works Correctly)
```
Total keys: 88
Total unique LEDs used: 246
LEDs shared by multiple keys: 243  ✅
Avg LEDs per key: 5.76
Min/Max LEDs per key: 4/6
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | No-Overlap | With-Overlap |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **LEDs per Key** | 2-3 | 4-6 |
| **Shared LEDs** | 0 | 243 |
| **Avg per Key** | 2.79 | 5.76 |
| **Use Case** | Precise, per-key control | Smooth transitions |
| **Visual Effect** | Sharp key boundaries | Continuous blend |

## Files Modified

- `backend/config_led_mapping_advanced.py` - Lines ~120-200
  - Replaced position-based overlapping calculation with strict partitioning
  - Maintained backward compatibility with with-overlap mode

## Testing & Verification

✅ **Verified on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W:**
- Service restarted successfully
- Both modes switchable via `/api/calibration/distribution-mode` endpoint
- No-overlap mode: 0 LED overlaps (verified with detailed LED-to-key mapping analysis)
- With-overlap mode: 243 overlaps (smooth transitions as designed)

## Deployment

Simply restart the service after the code change:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart piano-led-visualizer
```

The fix automatically takes effect. No configuration changes needed.
