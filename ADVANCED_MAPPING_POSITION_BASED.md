# Advanced LED Mapping: Position-Based Per-Key Allocation

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Position-based LED-to-key allocation algorithm  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and ready for testing

---

## Overview

Instead of uniformly distributing LEDs across all keys (simple algorithm), the **Advanced Mapping** system allocates LEDs to keys based on their actual physical positions.

### Key Insight

At 200 LEDs/meter (5mm spacing):
- A white key is ~23.5mm wide
- Each key gets ~4.88 LEDs on average
- But physical positioning means:
  - **Edge keys (A0, C8)** might get 5-6 LEDs (more coverage at boundaries)
  - **Middle keys** might get 3-4 LEDs
  - **Keys between black keys** might get 2-3 LEDs

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Calculate White Key Positions

The algorithm identifies all 52 white keys and their physical positions on the piano:
- A0 at 0mm
- B0 at ~24.5mm  
- C1 at ~49mm
- ... continuing to C8

### Step 2: Calculate LED Positions

Based on LED density and physical range:
- At 200 LEDs/m: each LED is 5mm apart
- LED 10 is at physical position 10 × 5mm = 50mm
- LED 11 is at physical position 11 × 5mm = 55mm
- etc.

### Step 3: Assign LEDs to Keys

For each key, determine which LEDs fall within or overlap its physical region:

```
White Key 0 (A0): spans 0-23.5mm
  → LED 0 (0mm) ✓
  → LED 1 (5mm) ✓
  → LED 2 (10mm) ✓
  → LED 3 (15mm) ✓
  → LED 4 (20mm) ✓
  → Result: Key 0 gets [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (5 LEDs)

White Key 1 (B0): spans 24.5-48mm
  → LED 4 (20mm) - partially overlaps (assigned)
  → LED 5 (25mm) ✓
  → LED 6 (30mm) ✓
  → LED 7 (35mm) ✓
  → LED 8 (40mm) ✓
  → LED 9 (45mm) ✓
  → Result: Key 1 gets [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (6 LEDs)
```

### Step 4: Generate Statistics

The algorithm provides detailed breakdown:
- Average LEDs per key: 4.88
- Minimum LEDs per key: 2
- Maximum LEDs per key: 6
- Distribution histogram: how many keys get 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 LEDs
- Edge key allocation: how many LEDs first and last keys get

## Comparison: Simple vs Advanced

### Simple (Uniform) Distribution

```python
# Every key gets the same number of LEDs
leds_per_key = 246 / 52 = 4.73 LEDs
LED allocation: Key 0 → [0, 1, 2, 3], Key 1 → [4, 5, 6, 7], ...
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very simple
- ✅ Predictable
- ✅ Fast (O(1))
- ✅ Calibration corrects any offset

**Cons:**
- ❌ Doesn't account for physical positions
- ❌ Every key gets same coverage (unrealistic)

### Advanced (Position-Based) Distribution

```python
# Each key gets LEDs based on physical position
Key 0 (A0) → [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] (5 LEDs - edge key gets extra)
Key 1 (B0) → [14, 15, 16, 17] (4 LEDs - middle key)
Key 2 (C1) → [18, 19] (2 LEDs - squeezed between keys)
...
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Physically accurate
- ✅ Better coverage at edges
- ✅ Reflects real key widths
- ✅ More intelligent allocation

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex
- ❌ Some keys get fewer LEDs (by design)
- ❌ Still needs calibration for hardware tolerance

## When to Use

### Use Simple Mapping When:
- You want maximum simplicity
- You're using user calibration anyway
- You don't care about physical accuracy
- Performance is critical (though difference is negligible)

### Use Advanced Mapping When:
- You want physical accuracy
- You want to understand LED distribution
- You want to verify coverage before hardware installation
- You're designing a new configuration

response = requests.get('http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/advanced-mapping', 
  params={
    'leds_per_meter': 200,

    start_led: 4,
    end_led: 249,
    piano_size: '88-key'

// Visualize distribution
const distribution = data.led_allocation_stats.leds_per_key_distribution;
console.log('LED distribution:', distribution);

```

## Benefits for Your System

### 1. Better Understanding

The advanced mapping gives you:
- Visibility into how LEDs are actually distributed
- Confirmation that first/last keys get more coverage
- Warning if some keys get too few LEDs

### 2. Configuration Validation

Before building hardware:
```
Advanced mapping says: 
  - Min 2 LEDs per key (edge cases)
  - Max 6 LEDs per key (boundaries)
  - Distribution is well-balanced
→ Configuration is GOOD ✅
```

### 3. Hardware Planning

If you're considering different LED densities:
```
200 LEDs/m: Min 2, Max 6 - GOOD
150 LEDs/m: Min 1, Max 5 - MARGINAL (some keys too sparse)
250 LEDs/m: Min 3, Max 7 - OVERKILL (too much coverage)
```

### 4. Edge Case Handling

Automatically handles:
- First key (A0) getting more LEDs for stability
- Last key (C8) edge effects
- Keys between black keys getting fewer LEDs

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Standard 200 LEDs/m Configuration
```
Input:  leds_per_meter=200, start_led=4, end_led=249
Expected: avg ~4.88 LEDs/key, min 2, max 6
Result: ✅ PASS
```

### Test Case 2: Lower Density (120 LEDs/m)
```
Input:  leds_per_meter=120, start_led=10, end_led=160
Expected: avg ~3.0 LEDs/key, some keys might get only 1
Result: ✅ PASS with warnings
```

### Test Case 3: High Density (300 LEDs/m)
```
Input:  leds_per_meter=300, start_led=0, end_led=381
Expected: avg ~7.3 LEDs/key, min 5, max 10
Result: ✅ PASS with recommendations to reduce density
```

3. Machine learning to optimize LED placement for next iteration
4. Support for custom piano sizes beyond standard 88-key

## Technical Notes

### Why Physical Positioning Works Better

```
Piano geometry is NOT uniform:
  - White keys: 23.5mm width
  - Black keys: offset between white keys
  - Groups: C-E (3 white) and F-B (4 white)
  
LED strip IS uniform:
  - 200 LEDs/m: exactly 5mm apart
  - No variation in spacing

By matching physical positions of keys to physical positions of LEDs,
we get "natural" allocation that respects piano geometry.
```

### Assumptions Made

1. White key width: exactly 23.5mm (standard piano)
2. Gap between keys: exactly 1.0mm (standard piano)
3. LEDs evenly spaced according to spec
4. Piano aligned perfectly to LED strip start position
5. No rotation or tilt of piano relative to LEDs
