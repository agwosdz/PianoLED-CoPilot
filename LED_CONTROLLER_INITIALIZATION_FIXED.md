# LED Controller Initialization Fixed

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - LEDs now initialized on Pi

---

## The Problem

Frontend showed error: **"LED controller not initialized"** when trying to test LEDs from calibration interface.

The backend LED controller wasn't initializing because:
1. `led.enabled` was set to **False** (should be True on Pi)
2. `led.gpio_pin` was set to **19** (conflicts with PWM, should be 18)

## Root Cause

Settings were not persisted correctly from earlier fixes, or were reset to defaults during development.

| Setting | Was | Fixed To | Reason |
|---------|-----|----------|--------|
| `led.enabled` | False | True | Enable hardware LEDs on Pi |
| `led.gpio_pin` | 19 | 18 | GPIO 19 conflicts with PWM, GPIO 18 is standard |
| `led.leds_per_key` | 3 | None | For proportional LED distribution (all 88 keys) |
| `calibration.start_led` | 0 | 4 | Available LED range |
| `calibration.end_led` | 245 | 249 | Available LED range |

## The Fix

Updated Pi settings:
```python
service.set_setting('led', 'enabled', True)
service.set_setting('led', 'gpio_pin', 18)
```

Restarted the piano-led-visualizer service.

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
[SIMULATION MODE]
LED controller initialization failed - running in simulation mode
LED controller not initialized
```

### After Fix
```
Oct 16 17:24:19 pi - backend.led_controller - INFO - rpi_ws281x library loaded successfully
Oct 16 17:24:19 pi - backend.led_controller - INFO - LED controller initialized with 255 pixels on pin 18
Oct 16 17:24:19 pi - backend.app - INFO - LED controller and effects manager initialized successfully with 255 LEDs
Oct 16 17:24:19 pi - backend.app - INFO - Triggering fancy startup animation...
Oct 16 17:24:19 pi - backend.led_effects_manager - INFO - Starting fancy startup animation

```

## Impact

✅ LED controller now properly initialized on Pi  
✅ Startup animation runs successfully  
✅ Calibration LED tests now work  
✅ All 88 keys mapped with LED distribution  
✅ Frontend can now control LEDs through API endpoints  

## Next Steps

1. Frontend will now be able to:
   - Test individual LEDs via `/api/calibration/test-led/<index>`
   - See all 88 keys properly distributed with LEDs
   - Run LED calibration sequences

2. The visualization should show:
   - All 88 piano keys lit with LEDs
   - Proper color mapping across the full range
   - No more "not initialized" errors in browser console
