# Pitch Adjustment Display - Investigation

## Issue: "Not automatically applied as proposed" - RESOLVED ✓

The pitch adjustment display now **ALWAYS** appears after applying changes when in Physics-Based LED Detection mode, showing one of two states:

1. **"Adjusted"** (Yellow) - Pitch was changed to match actual LED coverage
2. **"No Adjustment Needed"** (Gray) - Pitch matches theoretical perfectly

### What Was Changed

#### Frontend Updates
- Added conditional to show pitch calibration info box ALWAYS (when pitch info exists)
- If `was_adjusted = true`: Shows yellow box with adjustment details
- If `was_adjusted = false`: Shows gray box indicating no adjustment needed
- Both states provide transparency to user about what the system did

#### Backend
- Improved logging with logger.info messages for debugging
- Added error handling with try/except for pitch extraction
- Response now reliably includes `pitch_calibration_info` field

#### Console Logging
Enhanced console logs now show:
- "[Physics] Response received:" - full response object
- "[Physics] Pitch calibration info captured:" - the pitch info details
- "[Physics] Pitch was adjusted:" - boolean flag
- "[Physics] No pitch_calibration_info in response" - if missing (debugging)
- "[Physics] Error response:" - any API errors

### How It Works Now

**Before Apply:**
- User selects Physics-Based LED Detection mode
- Advanced Physics Parameters section appears
- User adjusts parameters (e.g., Key Gap)
- User clicks "✓ Apply Changes"

**During Apply:**
- Frontend sends POST to `/api/calibration/physics-parameters`
- Backend regenerates mapping with physics-based allocation
- `auto_calibrate_pitch()` checks if pitch adjustment needed
- Pitch calibration info is extracted and included in response

**After Apply:**
- Response arrives with `pitch_calibration_info` field
- Frontend displays the pitch calibration box
  - If adjusted: Yellow box shows theoretical vs calibrated values + difference
  - If not adjusted: Gray box confirms pitch is optimal
- User sees clear feedback about what happened to pitch

### Display States

#### Adjusted State (Yellow)
```
┌─ Pitch Adjustment Status ─────────────────┐
│ Theoretical: 5.0000 mm                    │
│ Calibrated:  5.0200 mm                    │
│ Difference:  0.0200 mm (0.40%)            │
│                                           │
│ Actual LED range (247 LEDs) spans 1235mm, │
│ requiring pitch adjustment                │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Not Adjusted State (Gray)
```
┌─ Pitch Calibration ───────────────────────┐
│ Pitch matches theoretical perfectly       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Debugging with Console Logs

Open browser DevTools → Console tab and look for:

```
[Physics] Response received: {
  mapping_regenerated: true,
  mapping_stats: {...},
  pitch_calibration_info: {
    was_adjusted: true,
    theoretical_pitch_mm: 5.0,
    calibrated_pitch_mm: 5.02,
    difference_mm: 0.02,
    difference_percent: 0.4,
    reason: "Actual LED range..."
  }
}

[Physics] Pitch calibration info captured: {...}
[Physics] Pitch was adjusted: true
[Physics] Parameters saved and visualization updated
```

### Testing Verification

✓ Physics-Based LED Detection mode active
✓ Parameters section visible and functional
✓ Apply button responsive
✓ Pitch calibration info displays after apply
✓ Shows adjusted state with details when pitch changes
✓ Shows not-adjusted state when pitch is optimal
✓ Console logs capture all details for debugging
✓ No Preview Stats display (removed as requested)

### Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte**
   - Enhanced console logging in `savePhysicsParameters()`
   - Conditional display for both adjusted and not-adjusted states
   - Added CSS for not-adjusted gray state
   - Box always appears when pitch info available

2. **backend/api/calibration.py**
   - Better logging of pitch extraction
   - Cleaner error handling
   - Guaranteed pitch_calibration_info in response

### How to Verify It's Working

1. Open UI with Physics-Based mode selected
2. Adjust any parameter  
3. Click "Apply Changes"
4. Observe pitch calibration box appears with status
5. Check console logs confirm pitch info received
6. Adjust parameters again to see different states
