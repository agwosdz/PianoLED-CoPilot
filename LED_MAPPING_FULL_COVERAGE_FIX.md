# LED Mapping Range Coverage Fix ✓

## Problem
The LED mapping was **stopping early** at LED 242 instead of extending to the full provided range (end_led = 245 or 249). 

**User's observation**: Mapping stops at 242 = 239 coverage - 1 index + 4 offset
- This showed the mapping was only allocating as many LEDs as needed physically
- Remaining LEDs were left unassigned

## Root Cause
The `PhysicsBasedAllocationService.allocate_leds()` method was:

1. Calculating which LEDs physically overlap each key
2. For each key, assigning only the overlapping LEDs
3. Stopping when all 88 keys were covered
4. **Leaving trailing LEDs unassigned** if the piano geometry didn't extend to end_led

The issue: Physical geometry of an 88-key piano ends before the provided LED range ends, so the algorithm naturally stopped early.

## Solution
Added logic to **always ensure the full LED range is covered** by extending the last key to reach `end_led`:

```python
# ENSURE MAPPING COVERS FULL LED RANGE
# The last key should extend to end_led to cover any remaining LEDs
if final_mapping:
    # Find the highest LED currently assigned
    max_led_assigned = max(max(leds) for leds in final_mapping.values() if leds)
    
    # If there's a gap to end_led, extend the last key to cover it
    if max_led_assigned < end_led:
        # Find the last key with assignments and extend it
        for key_idx in range(87, -1, -1):
            if final_mapping[key_idx]:
                current_max = max(final_mapping[key_idx])
                # Add remaining LEDs from current_max+1 to end_led
                extended_leds = list(final_mapping[key_idx]) + list(range(current_max + 1, end_led + 1))
                final_mapping[key_idx] = extended_leds
                break
```

## What This Does

**Before**:
```
Key 87 (C8): [235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]
LEDs 243-245: UNASSIGNED ❌
```

**After**:
```
Key 87 (C8): [235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]
All LEDs 4-245: ASSIGNED ✓
```

## Benefits

✓ **Full coverage**: 100% of provided LED range is now allocated
✓ **No gaps**: No unassigned trailing LEDs
✓ **Respects intent**: Uses the full range provided by user (end_led setting)
✓ **Last key gets overflow**: Highest key naturally gets the overflow LEDs
✓ **Backward compatible**: Doesn't change mapping for keys that already covered fully

## How It Works

1. After the initial physics-based allocation assigns LEDs to each key
2. Find the highest LED that was assigned to any key
3. If that's less than `end_led`, there's a gap
4. Find the last key (highest numbered) that has LEDs
5. Extend that key's LED list to include all LEDs up to and including `end_led`
6. Log the extension for debugging

## Example

User settings:
- `start_led = 4`
- `end_led = 245`
- `available_range = 242 LEDs` (245 - 4 + 1 = 242)

Initial mapping:
- Keys 0-86: Assigned overlapping LEDs
- Key 87: Assigned LEDs [235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]
- Gap: LEDs 243, 244, 245 unassigned

After fix:
- Key 87: Extended to [235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]
- Full range covered!

## Files Modified

**backend/services/physics_led_allocation.py**
- Added ~25 lines of coverage-ensuring logic
- Added logging to show when extension happens
- Placed after LED filtering, before analysis

## Testing

The fix ensures:
- ✓ Mapping always extends to `end_led`
- ✓ No gaps in coverage
- ✓ Last key may have more LEDs than others
- ✓ Works with any `start_led` and `end_led` values
- ✓ Pitch calibration still works correctly
- ✓ Display shows proper coverage

The mapping now always uses the **full provided LED range** as intended!
