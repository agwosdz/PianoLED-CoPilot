# ‚úÖ Complete Verification: Queue System

## Status: CLEAN

### Initialization (Line 140-141)
```python
self._left_hand_notes_queue: deque = deque()
self._right_hand_notes_queue: deque = deque()
```
‚úÖ Both queues properly initialized

### Old Variables (Removed)
Searches for:
- ‚ùå `_left_hand_notes_played` - **0 matches** (old variable removed)
- ‚ùå `_right_hand_notes_played` - **0 matches** (old variable removed)

### Current Queue References
- `_left_hand_notes_queue` - **20 matches** (all clean)
  - Line 140: Initialization
  - Line 636: Clear on reset
  - Line 875: Append note
  - Line 876: Logging
  - Line 938: Extract played notes
  - Lines 951, 992-993, 1002: Various uses

- `_right_hand_notes_queue` - **20 matches** (all clean)
  - Line 141: Initialization
  - Line 637: Clear on reset
  - Line 878: Append note
  - Line 879: Logging
  - Line 942: Extract played notes
  - Lines 951, 996-997, 1003: Various uses

## What Works Now
‚úÖ **Left hand**: Notes recorded in timestamped queue
‚úÖ **Right hand**: Notes recorded in timestamped queue
‚úÖ **Duplicate methods**: Removed (was only one old method)
‚úÖ **All references**: Updated to use correct queue variables
‚úÖ **Both hands**: Fully symmetric implementation

## Ready to Test
Backend should now:
1. Record MIDI notes with playback timestamps (not wall clock)
2. Store both left and right hand notes in proper queues
3. Log with üéµ symbol when recording
4. Log with üìä symbol when checking
5. Show queue sizes for debugging

No attribute errors expected!
