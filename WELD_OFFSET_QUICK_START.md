# LED Strip Weld Offset - Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR

When LED strips are soldered together, the connection point may have slight misalignment. Use **weld offsets** to compensate for these ~1-5mm deviations.

---

## 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Identify Your Welds
Count LED strip segments and find solder joints:
```
Strip 1: LEDs 0-99
Strip 2: LEDs 100-199  ‚Üê Weld here at LED 100
Strip 3: LEDs 200-254
```

### 2. Measure Offset
Check if LEDs after weld are shifted forward (+) or backward (-):
- **Forward 3.5mm** ‚Üí offset: `+3.5`
- **Backward 1mm** ‚Üí offset: `-1.0`
- **Perfect** ‚Üí offset: `0` (or don't configure)

### 3. Apply Offset
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offset/100 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offset_mm": 3.5}'
```

### 4. Test
Play keys on the piano - LEDs should now align properly!

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Weld
**Strip**: 255 LEDs soldered at position 100

```bash
# Add weld
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offset/100 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offset_mm": 2.0}'

# Verify
curl http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offsets
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Welds
**Strip**: Three 100-LED segments joined at 100 and 200

```bash
# Configure both welds at once
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offsets/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "weld_offsets": {
      "100": 2.5,
      "200": -1.0
    }
  }'
```

### Scenario 3: Adjusting Existing Weld
**Current**: Weld at 100 with +3.5mm offset  
**Want**: Change to +2.0mm

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offset/100 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offset_mm": 2.0}'
```

### Scenario 4: Remove Weld
**Current**: Weld at 150 configured  
**Want**: Delete it

```bash
# Option 1: Set offset to 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offset/150 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offset_mm": 0}'

# Option 2: DELETE endpoint
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/offset/150
```

## Offset Values Quick Reference

| Observation | Offset Value | Action |
|---|---|---|
| LEDs look shifted forward | `+2.5` | Positive offset |
| LEDs look shifted backward | `-1.5` | Negative offset |
| LEDs look perfect | Don't add | No weld config needed |
| Not sure | Validate first | Use POST `/validate` |

---

## Validation Before Applying

```bash
# Test your config before saving
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/weld/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "weld_offsets": {
      "100": 3.5,
      "200": -1.2
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| LED alignment unchanged | Ensure weld LED index is correct; check `/offsets` to verify |
| "Offset out of range" error | Use -10.0 to +10.0 mm only; split larger offsets |
| Welds not applied to USB MIDI | Welds apply automatically; check that distribution_mode is correct |
| Want to undo | DELETE the weld and recalibrate from scratch |

---

## Offset Limits

- **Range**: -10.0 to +10.0 mm (typical weld deviations)
- **Typical value**: ¬±2-3 mm
- **Too large**: Indicates mechanical misalignment (check hardware) or incorrect LED index

---

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `backend/services/settings_service.py` - Settings schema
- ‚úÖ `backend/config.py` - LED mapping logic
- ‚úÖ `backend/api/calibration_weld_offsets.py` - REST endpoints (NEW)
- ‚úÖ `backend/app.py` - Blueprint registration

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test on hardware**: Apply weld offset and verify LED alignment
2. **Fine-tune**: Adjust offset values until perfect
3. **Document**: Note weld locations for future reference
4. **Export**: Backup settings for recovery
5. **Automate**: Consider frontend UI for weld management
