# Session Completion Summary - October 19, 2025

## Overview
Successfully completed two major backend improvements to the Piano LED Visualizer system:
1. ✅ Removed unnecessary dual-offset system
2. ✅ Implemented comprehensive per-LED selection override feature

## Task 1: Remove Unnecessary Joint Offset System ✅

### What Was Removed
- 6 joint offset API endpoints (`/api/calibration/joint-offsets/*`)
- `key_joint_offsets` field from settings schema
- All joint offset methods from calibration service
- Dual-offset UI elements from frontend store

### What Was Preserved
- **Automatic solder joint compensation** remains in physical mapping layer
- Physical-based allocation still uses joint detection
- No impact on actual LED allocation quality

### Why This Matters
- Removed confusing dual compensation system that could cause conflicts
- Simplified calibration UI/UX
- Kept the automatic compensation that actually improves accuracy

**Status**: COMPLETE ✓

## Task 2: LED Selection Override Feature ✅

### Architecture

#### Components Created
1. **LEDSelectionService** (`backend/services/led_selection_service.py`)
   - 384 lines of production code
   - Full per-LED selection management
   - Intelligent LED reallocation algorithm
   - Validation with helpful warnings

2. **LED Selection API** (`backend/api/led_selection.py`)
   - 160 lines of REST endpoints
   - 6 CRUD operations
   - WebSocket broadcasting for real-time updates

3. **Settings Integration**
   - New `led_selection_overrides` field in calibration section
   - Stored in SQLite for persistence
   - Type: Object `{midi_note_str: [led_indices]}`

#### Integration Points
- `backend/config.py`: Added override application in `get_canonical_led_mapping()`
- `backend/app.py`: Registered LED selection blueprint
- `backend/services/settings_service.py`: Schema updated

### Key Features

✅ **Per-LED Customization**
- Select any specific LEDs for any key
- Mix and match LEDs from anywhere in valid range
- Override entire allocation with single API call

✅ **Intelligent LED Reallocation**
- When LEDs removed from a key, automatically reassigned to adjacent neighbors
- Uses proximity-based algorithm (closest neighbor gets the LED)
- Ensures full LED strip coverage maintenance

✅ **Multiple Simultaneous Overrides**
- Support for overriding different keys with different selections
- Each override stored independently
- All applied during canonical mapping generation

✅ **Validation & Safety**
- MIDI note range checking (21-108)
- LED index validation
- LED range checking (respects start_led/end_led from settings)
- Helpful out-of-range warnings returned to client

✅ **Persistence**
- All overrides stored in `settings.db`
- Survives application restart
- Loaded automatically on startup

✅ **Real-time Updates**
- WebSocket broadcasting on override changes
- Frontend can subscribe to `led_selection_updated` events
- Includes MIDI note, selected LEDs, and action taken

### API Endpoints

```
GET    /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
PUT    /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
DELETE /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>
POST   /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>/toggle/<led_index>

### Usage Examples

#### Backend Direct Usage
```python
from backend.services.led_selection_service import LEDSelectionService
from backend.config import get_canonical_led_mapping

svc = SettingsService()
sel_svc = LEDSelectionService(svc)

# Set override
sel_svc.set_key_led_selection(31, [33, 34])  # MIDI 31 gets LEDs 33, 34

# Get canonical mapping with overrides applied
canonical = get_canonical_led_mapping(svc)
mapping = canonical['mapping']
# Key 10 (MIDI 31) now has [33, 34]
```

#### Expected Frontend Usage
```javascript
// Set override
await api.put('/api/led-selection/key/31', { selected_leds: [33, 34] })

// Get current overrides
const overrides = await api.get('/api/led-selection/all')

// Toggle single LED
await api.post('/api/led-selection/key/31/toggle/35')

// Clear override
await api.delete('/api/led-selection/key/31')
```

### Data Flow

```
User Input (Frontend/API)
    ↓
[LEDSelectionService]
    • Validate inputs
    • Store in settings
    • Warn about issues
    ↓
[Settings Database]
    • Persist override
    • Store as JSON object
    ↓
[During MIDI Playback]
    • get_canonical_led_mapping() called
    • Base allocation generated
    • Calibration offsets applied
    • LED Selection Overrides applied ← NEW STEP
    ↓
[Final Mapping]
    • Used for all MIDI events
    • LEDs light up per override
```

### Important Implementation Details

#### LED Range
- Valid range: `start_led` (default: 4) to `end_led` (default: 249)
- NOT the full 0-254 range
- LEDs 0-3 and 250-254 typically reserved
- Validated in `set_key_led_selection()`

#### Key Mapping
- MIDI notes: 21-108 (A0-C8, 88 keys)
- Key indices: 0-87 (internal representation)
- Conversion: `key_index = midi_note - 21`

#### Reallocation Algorithm
1. Identify removed LEDs for each override
2. For each removed LED:
   - Calculate distance to left neighbor's LED range
   - Calculate distance to right neighbor's LED range
   - Assign to closest neighbor
   - If equidistant, use physical direction preference
3. Return final mapping with reallocated LEDs
