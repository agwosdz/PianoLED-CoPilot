## What Was Built

### Priority 1: Validation Endpoints ✅
- `validate_auto_mapping_config()` function with 5-point validation
- `/api/calibration/mapping-validate` endpoint (POST)
- `/api/calibration/mapping-info` endpoint (GET)
- Provides: warnings, recommendations, quality score, statistics

### Priority 2: Enhanced Logging ✅
- `generate_auto_key_mapping()`: 15+ log statements
- `apply_calibration_offsets_to_mapping()`: 20+ log statements
- Tracks: distribution, truncation, cascading offsets, clamping, completion

### Priority 3: Comprehensive Tests ✅
- 36 tests covering all critical paths
- TestCalibrationOffsets (12 tests)
- TestAutoKeyMapping (9 tests)
- TestCascadingOffsets (10 tests)
- TestAutoMappingValidation (5 tests)

### Priority 4: Distribution Modes ✅
- 3 distribution strategies: proportional, fixed, custom
- Settings schema with configuration options
- `/api/calibration/distribution-mode` endpoint (GET/POST)
- 12 new tests for distribution logic
- **Result: 48 total tests, all passing**

---

## Test Suite Evolution

```
After Priority 1-2: 12 tests (existing)
After Priority 3:   36 tests (+24 new)
After Priority 4:   48 tests (+12 new)

Success Rate: 100% (48/48 passing) ✅
Execution Time: ~80ms total
```

---

## Distribution Modes In Detail

### Mode 1: Proportional (Default)
```
Strategy: Distribute LEDs evenly across all keys
Example: 88 keys, 100 LEDs → 1 LED/key + 12 extra
Result:  All 88 keys mapped, even distribution
Use Case: Maximize key coverage when LEDs limited
```

### Mode 2: Fixed
```
Strategy: Fixed number of LEDs per key
Example: 88 keys, 100 LEDs, 5/key → 20 keys mapped
Result:  Brighter keys, some unmapped
Use Case: Consistent brightness per key
```

### Mode 3: Custom
```
Strategy: Advanced/special distributions
Example: Weighted by key importance or register
Result:  User-configurable
Use Case: Advanced users, special needs
```

## Usage Guide

### Get Distribution Mode
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/calibration/distribution-mode
```

### Change to Fixed Mode
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/calibration/distribution-mode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "fixed", "fixed_leds_per_key": 3, "apply_mapping": true}'
```

### Validate Mapping
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/calibration/mapping-validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"piano_size": "88-key", "led_count": 246}'
```

### Get Mapping Info
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/calibration/mapping-info
```
