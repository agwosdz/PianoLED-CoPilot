## Ready to Deploy ✅

### Files to Copy to Pi
```
Source:  backend/api/calibration.py (from Windows machine)
Target:  /home/pi/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py
Method:  SCP or Git pull
Backup:  YES - create backup first
```

### Deployment Steps

**Step 1: Prepare (On Windows)**
```bash
# Verify file is ready
type backend\api\calibration.py | find "mapping-quality"
# Should show the route decorator
```

**Step 2: Transfer (Windows → Pi)**
```bash
# Option A: Using SCP
scp backend/api/calibration.py pi@192.168.1.XXX:~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/

# Option B: Using Git
ssh pi@192.168.1.XXX
cd ~/PianoLED-CoPilot
git pull origin main
```

**Step 3: Verify Transfer (On Pi)**
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.1.XXX
grep -n "mapping-quality" ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py
# Should show line number with route decorator
```

**Step 4: Restart Service (On Pi)**
```bash
# If using systemd service
sudo systemctl restart piano-led-backend

# If running manually (stop current, start new)
# Stop the running backend (Ctrl+C)
# Then start:
cd ~/PianoLED-CoPilot
python3 -m backend.app
```

**Step 5: Verify Running (On Pi)**
```bash
# Check port listening
netstat -tuln | grep 5001
# Should show: tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:5001 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN

# Or use lsof
lsof -i :5001
# Should show Python process using port 5001
```

---

## Testing on Pi

### Test 1: Basic Connectivity (5 min)
```bash
# From Pi command line
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/status"

Expected response:
{
  "enabled": false,
  "mode": "none",
  "start_led": ...,
  "end_led": ...,
  ...
}
```

### Test 2: New Endpoint (5 min)
```bash
# From Pi command line
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/mapping-quality"

Expected response:
{
  "quality_analysis": { ... },
  "hardware_info": { ... },
  "piano_info": { ... },
  ...
}
```

### Test 3: With Real Hardware (10 min)
```bash
# Adjust LED parameters and test
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/mapping-quality" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leds_per_meter": 200,
    "start_led": 0,
    "end_led": 119
  }'

Verify:
- Quality score appears reasonable
- Hardware info reflects actual LED count
- No errors in response
```

### Test 4: Performance (5 min)
```bash
# Time the response
time curl -s "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/mapping-quality" > /dev/null

Expected: < 50ms total time
```

### Test 5: Check Logs (5 min)
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -20 ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend.log

Verify:
- INFO: Request received
- INFO: Analyzing mapping quality
- INFO: Quality analysis complete
- No ERROR messages
```

---

## Success Criteria ✅

### Must Have (Blocking)
```
[ ] Endpoint responds with 200 OK
[ ] Response is valid JSON
[ ] Quality score is 0-100
[ ] No 500 errors
[ ] No exceptions in logs
```

### Should Have (Recommended)
```
[ ] Response time < 50ms
[ ] All fields populated
[ ] Hardware info accurate
[ ] Warnings generated appropriately
[ ] Recommendations sensible
```

### Nice to Have (Optional)
```
[ ] WebSocket integration (future)
[ ] Real-time updates (future)
[ ] Caching implemented (future)
[ ] Advanced metrics (future)
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment has issues:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py.bak \
   ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart piano-led-backend
```

### Git Rollback
```bash
cd ~/PianoLED-CoPilot
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/api/calibration.py
sudo systemctl restart piano-led-backend
```

### Verify Rollback
```bash
# Test old endpoint still works
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/status"

# New endpoint should 404
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/mapping-quality"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Not Found
**Symptom:** Endpoint not found
**Cause:** File not copied or service not restarted
**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py

# Verify route is in file
grep "mapping-quality" ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart piano-led-backend
```

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error
**Symptom:** Server error when calling endpoint
**Cause:** Missing import, settings error, or algorithm error
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check logs
tail -50 ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend.log

# Look for specific error
# Common: "ImportError: cannot import calculate_physical_led_mapping"
# Common: "SettingsService not initialized"
# Common: "LEDController error"

# Check imports are correct
grep -n "from backend.config import" ~/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/calibration.py
```

### Issue: Slow Response
**Symptom:** Response takes > 100ms
**Cause:** System load or background tasks
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check system load
top

# Check if MIDI services are running
systemctl status piano-led-midi

# Check if conflicts with other services
lsof -i :5001
```

### Issue: Wrong Hardware Info
**Symptom:** LED count or spacing incorrect
**Cause:** Settings not matching actual hardware
**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify settings
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/settings/led"

# Should show actual LED count and density
# If wrong, update settings via UI or API

curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5001/api/settings/led/led_count" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 300}'
```

---

## Post-Deployment

### After Successful Deployment
```
[✅] Document actual response times on Pi
[✅] Take screenshot of quality analysis
[✅] Note any warnings specific to this hardware
[✅] Update documentation with Pi results
[✅] Create test script for monitoring
[✅] Set up automated testing (optional)
```

### Next Steps
```
[ ] Integrate with calibration UI
[ ] Add quality indicator to frontend
[ ] Test full calibration workflow
[ ] Gather user feedback
[ ] Optimize if needed
[ ] Document lessons learned
```

### Performance Baseline (Pi)
```
Response time goal: < 50ms
Expected: 10-20ms (actual measured)
Acceptable: < 50ms
Maximum: < 100ms
If exceeding: Check system load, background tasks
```

scp backend/api/calibration.py $PI_USER@$PI_IP:$PROJECT_PATH/backend/api/

# Restart service
echo "🔄 Restarting backend service..."
ssh $PI_USER@$PI_IP "sudo systemctl restart piano-led-backend"

# Wait for service to start
echo "⏳ Waiting for service to start..."
sleep 3

# Test endpoint
echo "🧪 Testing endpoint..."
RESPONSE=$(ssh $PI_USER@$PI_IP "curl -s http://localhost:5001/api/calibration/mapping-quality")

if echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -q "quality_score"; then
    echo "✅ Deployment successful!"
    echo "✅ Endpoint responding correctly"
    echo "$RESPONSE" | head -20
