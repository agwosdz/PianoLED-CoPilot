# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Offset Fix Complete

## 🎯 Issue
User's MIDI 42 (F#2) offset of -1 was not being applied to physics-based LED mappings.

## 🔍 Root Causes
Two critical bugs were identified:
1. **Distribution mode ignored**: `/key-led-mapping` endpoint always used Piano-Based allocation
2. **Offset key mismatch**: Mapping uses key indices (0-87), offsets use MIDI notes (21-108)

## ✅ Solution
Both bugs fixed in `backend/api/calibration.py`:
1. Added conditional routing based on `distribution_mode`
2. Added MIDI-to-index conversion for offsets before applying

## 📈 Before/After

```
BEFORE:
  Physics-Based + MIDI 42 offset -1 → LEDs [12, 13, 14] ✗ (ignored)

AFTER:
  Physics-Based + MIDI 42 offset -1 → LEDs [11, 12, 13] ✓ (applied)
```

## 🚀 Status
- **Code**: ✅ Complete
- **Tests**: ✅ Pass
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete
- **Ready for Pi**: ✅ Yes
