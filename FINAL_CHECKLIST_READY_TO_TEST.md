## 🎬 Animation Test Protocol

### What Happens When You Click Play

**Immediately**:
1. Button changes from "▶ Play" to "⏸ Pause"
2. Backend starts playback thread
3. Backend begins advancing `current_time`

**First Update (within 100ms)**:
1. Frontend polls `/api/playback-status`
2. Receives `state: "playing"` and `current_time: 0.10`
3. Debug display updates to `"Playing: true"`
4. Animation triggers

**Continuous (every 100ms)**:
1. `current_time` advances
2. For each note: `topPercent = ((4 - (startTime - currentTime)) / 4) * 100`
3. Notes move from 100% (top) toward 0% (keyboard)
4. Animation visible and smooth

- ✅ 15 visible at any time
- ✅ Colors accurate
- ✅ Positioning correct

### Animation Quality
- ✅ Smooth motion (60fps target)
- ✅ No stuttering
- ✅ Accurate timing
- ✅ Responsive controls

### System Stability
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ No memory leaks

- ✅ Clean shutdown

---

## 🔍 Debugging Tools Available

### Browser Console
```javascript
// Watch for these logs:
// - "▶ Playing: song.mid" (confirms play start)
// - "[0.50s] Visible: 15/453 notes" (confirms polling)
// - Any error messages (would indicate issues)
```

### Network Tab
```
Monitor these endpoints:
- /api/playback-status (every 100ms)
- /api/midi-notes (on file selection)
- /api/play (on play click)
- /api/pause (on pause click)
- /api/stop (on stop click)
```

### Backend Logs
```
Look for:
- "Loaded MIDI file" (confirms file loading)
- "Playback started" (confirms playback thread)
- "Current time: X.XXs" (confirms time advancement)
- Any error messages
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Check | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Play button doesn't work | Network tab for 500 errors | Restart backend |
| Time not advancing | `/api/playback-status` response | Check backend playback thread |
| Notes not falling | Browser console for errors | Reload page |
| Animation stutters | Browser CPU usage | Close other apps |
| Wrong colors | Check hand threshold (< 54) | Verify MIDI note range |
| Sound not playing | Audio not implemented | Expected (visualization only) |
