# Auto Mapping Evaluation - Executive Summary

Date: October 16, 2025

## üìã What Was Evaluated

The **automatic key-to-LED mapping system** that:
- Generates mappings for all piano sizes (25-key to 88-key)
- Distributes LEDs across keys proportionally
- Applies global and cascading per-key offsets
- Integrates with the calibration API

---

## ‚úÖ What Works Well

### Core Algorithm
- **Simple & Predictable:** Linear distribution is easy to understand
- **Flexible:** Supports fixed or calculated LEDs-per-key
- **Scalable:** Works with any piano size and LED count
- **Type Safe:** Handles string/int normalization from database

### Integration
- **API-First:** Clean REST endpoint with JSON response
- **Settings-Driven:** Reads configuration from persistent database
- **Offset Ready:** Applies calibration adjustments automatically
- **Error Handling:** Bounds checking prevents invalid LED access

### Testing
- Existing unit tests cover main scenarios
- Per-key offsets tested
- Bound clamping verified

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### 1. Uneven LED Distribution (MEDIUM)
- **Problem:** First keys get extra LED if LEDs don't divide evenly
- **Example:** 250 LEDs √∑ 88 keys = 74 keys with 3 LEDs, 14 keys with 2 LEDs
- **Impact:** Brightness inconsistency across keyboard
- **Severity:** Medium (visual, not functional)

### 2. Silent Truncation (MEDIUM)
- **Problem:** When `leds_per_key` specified, unmapped keys are silent
- **Example:** 3 LEDs/key with 250 LEDs ‚Üí only 83 keys mapped, 5 keys unknown
- **Impact:** User doesn't realize some keys have no LEDs
- **Severity:** Medium (causes confusion)

### 3. Limited Logging (LOW)
- **Problem:** No visibility into distribution or warnings
- **Example:** Can't tell how many keys got extra LEDs
- **Impact:** Debugging difficult
- **Severity:** Low (informational)

### 4. Cascading Offsets Unintuitive (LOW)
- **Problem:** Offset at note N affects all notes ‚â• N
- **Example:** Offset at C3 affects C3, C#3, D3, ... (entire rest of keyboard)
- **Impact:** Could be confusing if user expects only C3 affected
- **Severity:** Low (powerful feature, just needs documentation)

### 5. No Configuration Options (LOW)
- **Problem:** Distribution mode hardcoded to first-keys-first
- **Impact:** Can't optimize for user preference
- **Severity:** Low (edge case)

## üìä Test Coverage Analysis

### Currently Tested ‚úÖ
- [x] Offsets disabled ‚Üí no change
- [x] Global offset applied
- [x] Per-key offset applied
- [x] Combined offsets
- [x] Negative offsets

### Not Tested ‚ùå
- [ ] Cascading offset accumulation (multiple offsets stacking)
- [ ] Edge case: More LEDs than keys
- [ ] Edge case: Fewer LEDs than keys (truncation)
- [ ] String key normalization
- [ ] Invalid MIDI notes
- [ ] Remainder LED distribution logic
- [ ] Base offset application
- [ ] All piano sizes (25, 37, 49, 61, 76, 88 key)

## üéØ Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: QUICK WINS (Do These First)
1. ‚úÖ **Add validation endpoint** (1-2 hours)
   - Returns warnings and statistics
   - No breaking changes
   - High user value

2. ‚úÖ **Improve logging** (30 minutes)
   - Log remainder distribution
   - Warn on silent truncation
   - Log mapping statistics

3. ‚úÖ **Add mapping-info endpoint** (1-2 hours)
   - Show LED distribution details
   - Show warnings
   - Show recommendations

### Priority 2: SHOULD DO (Medium Effort)
4. **Add comprehensive tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Cascading offset tests
   - Edge case tests
   - All piano sizes

5. **Make distribution mode configurable** (2 hours)
   - Add setting to database
   - Implement "even", "spread", "end" modes
   - Update API to use setting

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Future)
6. **Add offset mode selection** (1-2 hours)
   - "cascading" (current) vs "independent"
   - Use-case dependent
   - Document cascading behavior clearly

7. **Frontend UI improvements** (3-4 hours)
   - Show mapping statistics on settings page
   - Display warnings/recommendations
   - Allow mode selection in UI

## üìà Impact Assessment

### What Fixing These Issues Would Improve:

| Issue | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Uneven distribution | Visual quality | Medium | M2 |
| Silent truncation | User confusion | Low | M1 |
| Limited logging | Debugging | Low | M1 |
| Cascading confusion | Documentation | Low | M3 |
| No configuration | Flexibility | Medium | M2 |

## üîç Key Findings

### Algorithm Quality: 8/10
The algorithm is sound and well-tested for basic cases. It handles edge cases reasonably well (clamping, bounds checking). Main limitation is the lack of configuration options.

### Integration Quality: 9/10
Integration with settings, calibration, and API is clean and follows project patterns. Error handling is robust.

### Documentation Quality: 4/10
Algorithm behavior is not well documented:
- Cascading offsets not explained
- Distribution strategy not explained
- Edge case handling not described

### Test Coverage: 6/10
Basic cases covered well, but missing edge cases and integration tests.

## ‚ùì Questions for User

1. **Distribution Preference:** How important is even brightness across keyboard?
   - Current: First keys brighter (3 LEDs vs 2 LEDs)
   - Priority: Low/Medium/High?

2. **Truncation Handling:** How to handle insufficient LEDs?
   - Current: Silent (no warning)
   - Options: Warn, Suggest smaller piano, Use fewer LEDs/key?

3. **Offset Mode:** Should offsets be cascading or independent?
   - Current: Cascading (affects all higher notes)
   - Preference: Keep cascading? Or add option?

4. **Timeline:** When would you like these improvements?
   - Immediate: Just validation + logging (quick)
   - Soon: Plus configuration options (medium)
   - Later: Nice-to-have features (future)
