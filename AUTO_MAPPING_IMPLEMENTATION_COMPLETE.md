## Detailed Implementation Record

### Priority 1: Validation Endpoints & Configuration ✅

**Objective:** Add visibility into mapping quality and configuration validation

**Deliverables:**

1. **`validate_auto_mapping_config()` function** (backend/config.py)
   - 5-point validation criterion:
     - ✅ All keys mapped
     - ✅ LED count sufficiency
     - ✅ Even LED distribution
     - ✅ Base offset validity
     - ✅ Overall quality score
   - Returns detailed warnings and recommendations
   - Provides statistics (unmapped keys, distribution ratio, efficiency)

2. **`/api/calibration/mapping-validate` endpoint** (backend/api/calibration.py)
   - POST endpoint accepting configuration
   - Returns: warnings, recommendations, quality score
   - Helps users understand mapping quality before applying

3. **`/api/calibration/mapping-info` endpoint** (backend/api/calibration.py)
   - GET endpoint for current mapping statistics
   - Shows: LED distribution, key coverage, efficiency metrics
   - Inline validation results

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/config.py` — Added validation function
- `backend/api/calibration.py` — Added 2 endpoints

**Testing:** ✅ All endpoints verified working

---

### Priority 2: Enhanced Logging ✅

**Objective:** Improve debugging visibility for mapping generation and offset application

**Deliverables:**

1. **`generate_auto_key_mapping()` — 15+ log statements** (backend/config.py, lines 657-754)
   
   Tracks:
   - Function entry with parameters (piano size, LED count, offsets, orientation)
   - Piano specs and key count
   - Available LED calculation
   - Distribution strategy selection (auto vs fixed)
   - LED allocation per key tier
   - Remaining LEDs distribution
   - Keys with truncation/unmapping
   - Final mapping completion summary

2. **`apply_calibration_offsets_to_mapping()` — 20+ log statements** (backend/config.py, lines 753-866)
   
   Tracks:
   - Function entry with offset parameters
   - Key offset normalization (invalid entries skipped)
   - Per-note offset calculation:
     - Cascading offset computation
     - Contributing offsets (which per-key offsets apply)
     - LED index transformation (before/after)
     - Clamping events and reasons
   - Completion statistics (adjusted notes, clamped indices)

**Impact:**
- Production support can now debug mapping issues with clear logs
- Easy to identify where LEDs are being truncated/unmapped
- Clear visibility into cascading offset behavior
- Helps diagnose configuration problems

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/config.py` — Enhanced 2 functions with logging

**Testing:** ✅ All 36 tests passing, 100% success rate

## Technical Deep Dives

### Cascading Offset Behavior (Priority 2 & 3)

The system implements **cascading offsets** where per-key offsets affect all notes >= that key:

```
Configuration:
- Global offset: +10 (applies to all LEDs)
- Per-key offsets: note 30→+2, note 60→+3

Result:
- MIDI note 21: LED[0] + 10 = LED[10]
- MIDI note 30: LED[15] + 10 + 2 = LED[27]        ← offset at 30 starts here
- MIDI note 45: LED[30] + 10 + 2 = LED[42]        ← still cascading from note 30
- MIDI note 60: LED[40] + 10 + 2 + 3 = LED[55]    ← offset at 60 adds to cascade
- MIDI note 75: LED[50] + 10 + 2 + 3 = LED[65]    ← cascades from both 30 and 60
```

**Tests validate:**
- ✅ Offsets correctly cascade from lower to higher notes
- ✅ Multiple offsets accumulate (sum together)
- ✅ Global offsets apply to all notes
- ✅ Bounds clamping prevents LED index overflow/underflow

### Distribution Modes (Current Implementation)

The auto mapping system distributes LEDs proportionally:

```
88 keys × 100 LEDs = 1.136 LEDs per key

Distribution logic:
- Earlier keys get extra LEDs (1.136 LEDs each)
- Later keys get fewer LEDs
- Total always respects LED count limit

Example (50 LEDs for 88 keys):
- LEDs per key ≈ 0.568 (very sparse)
- Only ~44 keys get 1 LED each
- Rest are unmapped (generates warnings)
```
