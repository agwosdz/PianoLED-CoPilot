# Learning Mode Fix - Code Changes Reference

## File 1: backend/playback_service.py

### Change 1.1: Import deque (Line 10)
```diff
  import logging
  import threading
  import time
  import json
  import os
- from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Callable, Any
+ from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Callable, Any, Tuple
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from enum import Enum
+ from collections import deque
  from backend.logging_config import get_logger
```
**Why:** Needed for timestamped queue structure

---

### Change 1.2: Replace Note Sets with Queues (Lines 136-145)
```diff
  # Learning mode configuration
  self._learning_mode_enabled = False
  self._left_hand_wait_for_notes = False
  self._right_hand_wait_for_notes = False
- self._left_hand_notes_played: set = set()
- self._right_hand_notes_played: set = set()
+ # Timestamped queues: [(note, timestamp), ...] - tracks notes with when they were played
+ self._left_hand_notes_queue: deque = deque()
+ self._right_hand_notes_queue: deque = deque()
  self._timing_window_ms = 500
  self._expected_notes: Dict[str, set] = {'left': set(), 'right': set()}  # Expected notes for current time window
+ self._last_queue_cleanup = time.time()  # For periodic queue cleanup
```
**Why:** Allows per-note timestamps for window-based filtering

---

### Change 1.3: Clear Queues at Playback Start (Lines 638-641)
```diff
  # Load and reset learning mode
  self._load_learning_mode_settings()
- self._left_hand_notes_played.clear()
- self._right_hand_notes_played.clear()
+ self._left_hand_notes_queue.clear()
+ self._right_hand_notes_queue.clear()
+ self._last_queue_cleanup = time.time()
```
**Why:** Reset queues at start of each playback session

---

### Change 1.4: Rewrite record_midi_note_played (Lines 850-883)

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```python
def record_midi_note_played(self, note: int, hand: str) -> None:
    """
    Record that a MIDI note was played during learning mode.
    
    Args:
        note: MIDI note number (0-127)
        hand: 'left' or 'right'
    """
    if hand == 'left':
        self._left_hand_notes_played.add(note)
        logger.debug(f"Learning mode: Left hand played note {note}")
    elif hand == 'right':
        self._right_hand_notes_played.add(note)
        logger.debug(f"Learning mode: Right hand played note {note}")
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
def record_midi_note_played(self, note: int, hand: str) -> None:
    """
    Record that a MIDI note was played by a specific hand during learning mode.
    
    Stores note with timestamp in a queue. Older notes are cleaned up automatically.
    
    Args:
        note: MIDI note number (0-127)
        hand: 'left' or 'right'
    """
    current_time = time.time()
    
    if hand == 'left':
        self._left_hand_notes_queue.append((note, current_time))
        # Periodic cleanup of old notes (older than 5 seconds)
        if current_time - self._last_queue_cleanup > 1.0:  # Cleanup every 1 second
            while (self._left_hand_notes_queue and 
                   current_time - self._left_hand_notes_queue[0][1] > 5.0):
                self._left_hand_notes_queue.popleft()
        logger.info(f"Learning mode: Left hand played note {note}, queue size: {len(self._left_hand_notes_queue)}")
    elif hand == 'right':
        self._right_hand_notes_queue.append((note, current_time))
        # Periodic cleanup of old notes (older than 5 seconds)
        if current_time - self._last_queue_cleanup > 1.0:  # Cleanup every 1 second
            while (self._right_hand_notes_queue and 
                   current_time - self._right_hand_notes_queue[0][1] > 5.0):
                self._right_hand_notes_queue.popleft()
            self._last_queue_cleanup = current_time
        logger.info(f"Learning mode: Right hand played note {note}, queue size: {len(self._right_hand_notes_queue)}")
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Stores timestamp with each note
- ✅ Automatically removes notes older than 5 seconds
- ✅ Periodic cleanup (every 1 second for efficiency)
- ✅ INFO-level logging with queue size
- ✅ Tracks cleanup timing separately

### Change 1.5: Complete Rewrite of _check_learning_mode_pause (Lines 880-947)

**BEFORE (Broken - ~60 lines):**

    return should_pause
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Extracts notes from QUEUES instead of global sets
- ✅ Only counts notes within the acceptance window
- ✅ Handles edge cases (empty windows, no expected notes)
- ✅ Detects and logs wrong notes
- ✅ Better formatted logging with sorted notes
- ✅ Includes TODO for red LED feedback
- ✅ More efficient early exit if learning disabled

## File 2: backend/midi_input_manager.py

### Change 2.1: Enhanced set_playback_service Logging (Lines 192-199)

**BEFORE:**
```python
def set_playback_service(self, playback_service) -> None:
    """
    Set reference to the playback service for learning mode note tracking.
    
    Args:
        playback_service: PlaybackService instance to track played notes during learning mode
    """
    self._playback_service = playback_service
    logger.debug("Playback service reference registered for learning mode")
```

**AFTER:**
```python
def set_playback_service(self, playback_service) -> None:
    """
    Set reference to the playback service for learning mode note tracking.
    
    Args:
        playback_service: PlaybackService instance to track played notes during learning mode
    """
    self._playback_service = playback_service
    if playback_service:
        logger.info("✓ Playback service reference registered for learning mode integration")
    else:
        logger.warning("✗ Playback service reference set to None")
```

**Why:** 
- INFO level ensures visibility
- Checkmark/X symbols for quick identification
- Detects None reference early

---

### Change 2.2: Enhanced _update_active_notes Logging (Lines 563-575)

**BEFORE:**
```python
                # Track note in playback service for learning mode
                if self._playback_service and hasattr(self._playback_service, 'record_midi_note_played'):
                    try:
                        # Determine hand based on note range (simple heuristic)
                        hand = 'left' if event.note < 60 else 'right'  # Middle C = 60
                        self._playback_service.record_midi_note_played(event.note, hand)
                        logger.debug(f"Learning mode: Recorded {hand} hand note {event.note}")
                    except Exception as e:
                        logger.debug(f"Error recording MIDI note for learning mode: {e}")
```

**AFTER:**
```python
                # Track note in playback service for learning mode
                if self._playback_service and hasattr(self._playback_service, 'record_midi_note_played'):
                    try:
                        # Determine hand based on note range (simple heuristic)
                        hand = 'left' if event.note < 60 else 'right'  # Middle C = 60
                        self._playback_service.record_midi_note_played(event.note, hand)
                        logger.info(f"[LEARNING MODE] {hand.upper()} hand note {event.note} recorded for playback service")
                    except Exception as e:
                        logger.error(f"ERROR recording MIDI note for learning mode: {e}")
                elif self._playback_service is None:
                    logger.debug(f"MIDI note {event.note} played but playback service not connected")
```

**Why:**
- INFO level with `[LEARNING MODE]` tag for easy filtering
- Uppercase hand for clarity
- ERROR level for exceptions
- Detects missing playback service reference

|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Imports | Added `deque` and `Tuple` | playback_service.py | 10 | Infrastructure |
| Data Structure | Replaced sets with timestamped deques | playback_service.py | 140 | **Critical** |
| Initialization | Clear new queue types | playback_service.py | 640 | **Critical** |
| Note Recording | Implement queue + cleanup + logging | playback_service.py | 850-883 | **Critical** |
| Pause Logic | Rewrite with window filtering | playback_service.py | 880-947 | **Critical** |
| Logging | Enhanced connection verification | midi_input_manager.py | 195 | Debugging |
| Logging | Enhanced note recording tracking | midi_input_manager.py | 568 | Debugging |

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- No API changes
- No configuration changes
- Existing code continues to work
- Only internal implementation changed

---

## Testing the Changes

### Compile Check
```bash
python -m py_compile backend/playback_service.py
python -m py_compile backend/midi_input_manager.py
# Should complete without errors (except pre-existing performance_monitor import)
```

### Runtime Check
```bash
python -m backend.app
# Should see: "✓ Playback service reference registered for learning mode integration"
```

### Functional Check
1. Load MIDI file
2. Enable "Wait for Right Hand"
3. Start playback
4. **Should pause**
5. Play any note
6. **Should resume**

## Performance Analysis

| Aspect | Before | After | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Memory per note | Set entry (~64 bytes) | Tuple (64 + timestamp) | Minimal increase |
| Memory limit | Unbounded | ~5 seconds worth | Bounded and cleaned |
| Lookup time | O(1) set membership | O(n) queue scan | n ≤ ~50, negligible |
| Cleanup cost | None | O(n) every 1 second | Spread over time |
| Thread safety | Unsafe (race condition) | Safe (deque atomic ops) | Improvement |
