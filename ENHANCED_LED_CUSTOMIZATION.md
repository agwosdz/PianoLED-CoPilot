# Enhanced LED Customization with Visual Representation

## Overview

The LED customization interface now displays currently assigned LEDs as visual, clickable representations. Users can easily see which LEDs are allocated to each key and intelligently reallocate them to adjacent keys with a single click.

## New Features

### 1. Current Allocation Display

When a user selects a MIDI note and enables "Customize LED allocation", they see:

**Currently Assigned LEDs Section**
- Large visual buttons showing the current LED allocation
- Green color with gradient (assigned state)
- Count badge showing total number of assigned LEDs
- Hint text: "Click an LED to move it to the adjacent key"

### 2. Visual State Indicators

**LED Button States**
- **Green (Active)**: Currently assigned to this key, still selected in your custom allocation
- **Red with ✕ (Removed)**: Currently assigned to this key, but you've removed it from the selection
- **Yellow (Unselected Current)**: Currently assigned to this key but not yet modified (in manual grid)
- **Blue (Selected Modified)**: Not currently assigned but selected in your custom allocation

### 3. Smart Reallocation

When clicking an assigned LED:
1. LED is removed from current key
2. System determines which edge it was on:
   - **Left edge** → Reallocates to previous key
   - **Right edge** → Reallocates to next key
3. System calculates midpoint automatically
4. Feedback message shows which key received the LED

### 4. Dual Grid Display

**Top Grid - Currently Assigned LEDs**
```
Shows only the LEDs currently assigned to the key
Larger buttons (45px) for easy clicking
Click to reallocate to adjacent keys
Removed LEDs shown in red with ✕ indicator
```

**Bottom Grid - Full LED Range**
```
Shows all available LEDs in the valid range
Smaller buttons (35px) for compact display
Toggle individual LEDs on/off manually
Yellow highlights show currently assigned LEDs
```

## User Workflow

### Scenario 1: Remove an LED from Key

```
1. User selects MIDI Note: 60 (Middle C)
2. Currently assigned LEDs shown: [120, 121, 122, 123]
3. User clicks LED 122
4. System:
   ├─ Removes LED 122 from C4
   ├─ Marks it as "removed" (red with ✕)
   ├─ Realizes it's on the right edge
   └─ Plans to reallocate to next key (D4)
5. User clicks "✓ Add Adjustment"
6. Both changes saved:
   ├─ C4 now has [120, 121, 123]
   └─ D4 receives LED 122 (automatically)
```

### Scenario 2: Manual LED Selection

```
1. User selects MIDI Note: 60
2. Currently assigned: [120, 121, 122, 123]
3. User scrolls to manual grid
4. User clicks LED 124 (yellow, currently assigned elsewhere)
5. LED 124 now moves to C4's selection
6. User clicks LED 120 to deselect
7. Selection now: [121, 122, 123, 124]
8. User clicks "✓ Add Adjustment"
9. Offsets calculated automatically
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Reallocation

```
1. Key 60 has: [120, 121, 122, 123]
2. Key 62 has: [124, 125, 126]
3. User selects Key 60 and removes LED 120 (left edge)
4. LED 120 reallocates to Key 59
5. User selects Key 62 and removes LED 125 (middle)
6. System determines right edge → reallocates to Key 63
7. Final state:
   ├─ Key 59: [..., 120]
   ├─ Key 60: [121, 122, 123]
   ├─ Key 62: [124, 126]
   └─ Key 63: [125, ...]
```

### Visual Hierarchy

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Currently Assigned LEDs (Click to Reallocate)
║  Count: 4 LEDs
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  [120] [121] [122] [123]  ← Large buttons
║  Hint: Click an LED to move it to the adjacent key
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Manual LED Selection (Optional)
║  [120][121][122]...[246]  ← Small buttons
║  (Yellow = currently assigned, Blue = selected)
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Variables

```typescript
// New variables
let currentKeyLEDAllocation: number[] = [];  // Current LEDs for selected key
let allKeysLEDMapping: Record<number, number[]> = {};  // All keys' allocations

// Enhanced on MIDI input
handleMidiNoteInput(midiNote):
  ├─ Load currentKeyLEDAllocation from ledMapping[midiNote]
  ├─ Check for existing override
  ├─ Pre-populate selectedLEDsForNewKey with current allocation
  └─ Initialize availableLEDsForForm
```

### Reallocation Logic

```typescript
handleReallocateLED(ledIndex):
  1. Check if LED is in currentKeyLEDAllocation
  2. Calculate midpoint of allocation range
  3. Determine target key:
     ├─ If ledIndex < midpoint → targetMidi = currentMidi - 1
     └─ If ledIndex > midpoint → targetMidi = currentMidi + 1
  4. Show feedback message
  5. (Reallocation happens when user saves)
```

### Visual Indicators

```css
/* Assigned LEDs - Large, green gradient */
.led-button-assigned {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #66bb6a, #43a047);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.3);
}

/* Removed LEDs - Red, faded */
.led-button-assigned.removed {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ef5350, #c62828);
  opacity: 0.6;
}

/* Currently assigned in grid - Yellow highlight */
.led-button-compact.current {
  background: #fff9c4;
  border-color: #f57f17;
}

/* Modified selection - Green */
.led-button-compact.selected {
  background: #66bb6a;
}
```

## User Experience Benefits

✅ **Visual Clarity** - See exactly which LEDs are allocated to each key
✅ **Easy Reallocation** - Single click to move LEDs between adjacent keys
✅ **Intelligent System** - Automatically determines reallocation target
✅ **Feedback** - Clear visual indicators of what's being changed
✅ **Flexible** - Both click-based reallocation and manual selection
✅ **Non-destructive** - Can see what's removed before saving
✅ **Efficient** - No need to manually count or calculate LED ranges

## Data Flow

### Saving with Reallocation

```
User clicks "✓ Add Adjustment"
    ↓
handleAddKeyOffset()
    ├─ selectedLEDsForNewKey = [121, 122, 123]
    ├─ currentKeyLEDAllocation = [120, 121, 122, 123]
    ├─ Removed: [120]
    │
    ├─ Save offset for MIDI 60
    ├─ Save LED override for MIDI 60 → [121, 122, 123]
    │
    ├─ Detect reallocation needed for LED 120
    ├─ Check if adjacent key exists (MIDI 59)
    ├─ If yes: Add 120 to MIDI 59's allocation
    └─ Update ledMapping in backend
    ↓
Show success message
Display updated allocations
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used

```
PUT /api/calibration/key-offsets/60
PUT /api/led-selection/key/60
(Backend handles reallocation logic)

The backend intelligent-reallocation system:
├─ Detects removed LEDs
├─ Finds destination keys (adjacent)
├─ Updates their allocations
└─ Maintains continuous LED coverage
```
