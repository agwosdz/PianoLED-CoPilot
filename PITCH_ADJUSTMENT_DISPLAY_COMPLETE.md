# Pitch Adjustment Display Implementation - COMPLETE ✓

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (CalibrationSection3.svelte)

#### Removed Preview Stats Display
- **Location**: Lines previously showing `{#if previewStats}` block after "Apply Changes" button
- **Change**: Completely removed the preview stats box that was displaying after applying changes
- **Reason**: As requested, this display was not needed in the UI

#### Added Pitch Adjustment Display Box
- **Location**: Within the parameters-grid (lines 897-920), spans full width (grid-column: 1 / -1)
- **Visibility**: Only displays when:
  - `pitchCalibrationInfo` is available AND
  - `pitchCalibrationInfo.was_adjusted` is true
  - This is the "locked to user" behavior - read-only display that appears when pitch was adjusted
  
- **Display Content**:
  - Status badge showing "Adjusted"
  - Theoretical pitch (mm)
  - Calibrated pitch (mm) 
  - Difference in mm and percentage
  - Reason for adjustment (explains why the pitch was changed)

- **Position**: Displays in the parameters grid below "Key Gap (mm)" and alongside "Overhang Threshold (mm)"
  - Locked styling makes it clear it's a read-only display

#### Updated State Management
- **Changed variable**: `previewStats: any = null` → `pitchCalibrationInfo: any = null`
- **Updated function**: `savePhysicsParameters()` now captures `pitch_calibration_info` from API response instead of `mapping_stats`

#### Styling Applied (Lines 1998-2063)
- `.pitch-adjustment-box`: Yellow/amber background gradient with border
- `.pitch-status-indicator`: Container for the status badge
- `.status-badge.adjusted`: Yellow badge indicating pitch was adjusted
- `.pitch-details`: White semi-transparent background showing the calibration metrics
- `.detail-label` & `.detail-value`: Styled to show parameter names and values clearly
- `.pitch-reason`: Italicized explanation of why adjustment was needed

### 2. Backend (calibration.py - /api/calibration/physics-parameters)

#### Updated POST Response
- **Location**: `get_set_physics_parameters()` endpoint, around line 2020-2040
- **Change**: When mapping is regenerated and physics-based allocation succeeds:
  1. Extract pitch calibration info from the mapping analysis
  2. Re-run `service.analyzer.analyze_mapping()` to get the full analysis including `pitch_calibration` field
  3. Return `pitch_calibration_info` in the response

- **Response Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "mapping_regenerated": true,
    "mapping_stats": {...},
    "pitch_calibration_info": {
      "was_adjusted": true,
      "theoretical_pitch_mm": 5.0,
      "calibrated_pitch_mm": 5.02,
      "difference_mm": 0.02,
      "difference_percent": 0.4,
      "reason": "Actual LED range (247 LEDs) spans 1235mm, requiring pitch adjustment",
      "theoretical_span_mm": 1230.0,
      "actual_span_mm": 1235.0
    }
  }
  ```

## How It Works

### When Pitch Gets Adjusted
1. User adjusts physics parameters (Key Gap, White Key Width, etc.)
2. User clicks "✓ Apply Changes"
3. Backend regenerates LED mapping using physics-based allocation
4. During mapping generation, `auto_calibrate_pitch()` is called to check if pitch needs adjustment
5. If actual LED coverage differs from theoretical, pitch is adjusted automatically
6. The `pitch_calibration` info is captured in the analysis

### Frontend Display
1. `savePhysicsParameters()` receives response with `pitch_calibration_info`
2. Component stores this in `pitchCalibrationInfo` state variable
3. If pitch was adjusted, the yellow box appears in the parameters grid
4. Shows all relevant calibration details so user understands what changed

### Why This Design
- **Locked/Read-only**: User can't edit pitch directly - it's automatically calibrated
- **Below Key Gap**: Positioned logically with other geometry parameters
- **Next to Overhang**: In the same parameters grid for easy comparison
- **Only shows when needed**: Doesn't clutter UI if no adjustment occurred
- **Removed Preview Stats**: Simplified UI by removing redundant stats display

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/lib/components/CalibrationSection3.svelte**
   - Line ~93: Changed `previewStats` to `pitchCalibrationInfo`
   - Line ~130: Updated `savePhysicsParameters()` to capture pitch info
   - Lines 897-920: Added pitch adjustment display box in parameters grid
   - Line 932+: Removed `{#if previewStats}` block
   - Lines 1998-2063: Added CSS styling for pitch adjustment display

2. **backend/api/calibration.py**
   - Lines 2040-2063: Updated `/physics-parameters` POST handler to extract and return pitch calibration info

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Open calibration UI in Physics-Based LED Detection mode
2. Adjust any parameter that would affect LED coverage (e.g., Key Gap)
3. Click "✓ Apply Changes"
4. Watch for the yellow "Pitch Adjustment Status" box to appear
5. Verify it shows theoretical vs calibrated pitch values
6. Confirm Preview Stats is no longer displayed after applying changes

### Expected Behavior
- ✓ Pitch adjustment box appears only when pitch was actually adjusted
- ✓ Box is in the parameters grid below Key Gap and alongside Overhang Threshold
- ✓ Display is read-only (no input fields)
- ✓ Preview Stats no longer appears after changes
- ✓ Pitch adjustment details are clear and informative

## Integration Complete ✓
All changes are backward compatible. The pitch adjustment info is only displayed when available and when pitch was actually adjusted. The UI is cleaner without the Preview Stats display.
