## 🎯 What You Need to Know in 60 Seconds

**Problem:** Learning mode pause wasn't working (playback never paused)

**Root Cause:** Notes accumulated in global sets forever without per-window filtering

**Solution:** 
1. Use timestamped `deque` instead of set
2. Filter notes by current timing window only
3. Auto-cleanup old notes every 5 seconds

**Result:** Pause now works correctly! ✅

**Test It:** 
1. Load MIDI file
2. Enable "Wait for Right Hand"
3. Start playback → **should pause**
4. Play a note → **should resume**
