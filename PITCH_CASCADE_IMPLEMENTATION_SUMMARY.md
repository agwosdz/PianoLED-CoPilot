# Implementation Complete: Pitch-Driven LED Mapping Cascade ✓

## What Was Implemented

A **smart, single-pass pitch calibration cascade** that automatically adjusts LED spacing when the physical piano geometry doesn't cover the full provided LED range.

## The Problem It Solves

When allocating LEDs to an 88-key piano with a large LED strip:

1. Physics-based allocation uses **physical overlap** to map LEDs to keys
2. If piano geometry is narrower than LED range, **mapping stops early**
3. This leaves trailing LEDs unassigned
4. **Solution**: Detect the gap and adjust pitch spacing to fill the gap

## The Solution: Three-Step Cascade

### Step 1: Generate Initial Mapping
```
• Use current LED pitch spacing
• Calculate which LEDs overlap which keys
• Apply overhang filtering
• Extend last key to reach end_led
• Detect max_led_assigned vs end_led
```
↓ Result: `initial_mapping`, `initial_max_led`

### Step 2: Calculate Pitch Adjustment
```
• Coverage gap = end_led - max_led_assigned
• Call auto_calibrate_pitch() with actual range
• Compares piano_width with available LEDs
• Returns adjusted pitch if coverage is insufficient
```
↓ Result: `calibrated_pitch`, `was_adjusted`

### Step 3: Regenerate (if Adjusted)
```
IF pitch was adjusted:
  • Update analyzer with new pitch spacing
  • Call _generate_mapping() AGAIN
  • Now with tighter LED spacing
  • Results in more LEDs covering piano

IF no adjustment needed:
  • Use initial_mapping as final
```
↓ Result: `final_mapping` (fully optimized)

## Code Architecture

### Main Entry Point
**`allocate_leds(start_led, end_led)`**
- Orchestrates the three-step cascade
- Returns complete result with pitch calibration info
- Logs each step clearly

### Reusable Helper
**`_generate_mapping(key_geometries, start_led, end_led)`**
- Encapsulates all LED mapping logic
- Can be called multiple times with different pitches
- Returns (mapping_dict, max_led_assigned)
- Handles: overlap detection, filtering, coverage extension

## Key Insight

The pitch adjustment is **reactive to actual coverage**:

```
Physical Coverage < Desired Coverage
           ↓
Pitch adjustment calculated
           ↓  
Pitch spacing TIGHTENED (LEDs closer together)
           ↓
More LEDs now overlap piano keys
           ↓
NEW mapping generated with better coverage
           ↓
Full LED range now utilized!
```

## Example

**Scenario**: Piano is 1200mm wide, but LED strip can fit 245 LEDs (4-249)

**Before fix**:
- Initial mapping reaches LED 242
- Gap detected: 3 LEDs unused
- No adjustment → mapping stops early ❌

**After fix**:
- Initial mapping reaches LED 242 (detects gap)
- Pitch adjusted from 5.0mm → 4.95mm
- Regenerated mapping reaches LED 245
- Full LED range utilized ✓

## Files Modified

**backend/services/physics_led_allocation.py**
- `allocate_leds()` - Now implements three-step cascade
- `_generate_mapping()` - New helper method (reusable)
- Added detailed logging at each step

## Performance Impact

- ✓ No adjustment case: **Single pass** (O(n))
- ✓ Adjustment case: **Two passes** (O(2n))
- ✓ Pitch updated **once** in analyzer
- ✓ No redundant calculations

## Frontend Integration

The frontend already displays:
- Yellow badge when pitch was adjusted ✓
- Gray badge when no adjustment needed ✓
- Adjustment details in UI ✓

The `pitch_calibration` data from response includes:
- `was_adjusted`: boolean
- `theoretical_pitch`: original spacing
- `calibrated_pitch`: adjusted spacing (if adjusted)
- `difference`: amount of adjustment

## Testing

After deployment, verify:

1. Apply physics parameters with default LED range
2. Check console logs for three-step cascade
3. Verify LED mapping extends to `end_led` (245 or 249)
4. UI shows pitch adjustment details when adjusted
5. No adjustment shown when coverage already optimal

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic optimization**: No manual pitch tweaking needed
✅ **Full coverage**: Utilizes entire LED strip range
✅ **Transparent**: Clear logging shows what happened
✅ **Efficient**: Single pass per pitch adjustment
✅ **Debuggable**: Three distinct, traceable steps
✅ **Maintainable**: Reusable _generate_mapping() helper

## Status

🟢 **Implementation Complete**
- Code refactored and optimized
- Cascade logic implemented
- Logging added at all steps
- Documentation complete
- Ready for testing
