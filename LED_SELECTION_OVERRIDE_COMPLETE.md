# LED Selection Override Feature - Implementation Complete ✓

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive per-LED selection override system that allows users to customize which specific LEDs are assigned to each piano key. The system intelligently reallocates removed LEDs to neighboring keys to maintain full LED strip coverage.

## Architecture

### Components Created

#### 1. **LEDSelectionService** (`backend/services/led_selection_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages per-LED selection overrides with intelligent reallocation
- **Key Methods**:
  - `set_key_led_selection(midi_note, selected_leds)` - Override LEDs for a key
  - `clear_key_led_selection(midi_note)` - Revert to auto-allocation
  - `get_key_led_selection(midi_note)` - Retrieve override for a key
  - `toggle_led_selection(midi_note, led_index)` - Add/remove single LED
  - `apply_overrides_to_mapping(base_mapping, start_led, end_led)` - Apply all overrides with reallocation
  - `_find_best_neighbor(key_index, led_index, mapping, ...)` - Smart neighbor selection
  - `get_all_overrides()` - Get all current overrides
  - `clear_all_overrides()` - Clear all overrides
  - `_get_led_range()` - Get valid LED range from settings

#### 2. **LED Selection API** (`backend/api/led_selection.py`)
- **Purpose**: REST endpoints for LED selection management with WebSocket broadcasting
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>` - Get override for key
  - `PUT /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>` - Set override for key
  - `DELETE /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>` - Clear override for key
  - `POST /api/led-selection/key/<midi_note>/toggle/<led_index>` - Toggle single LED
  - `GET /api/led-selection/all` - Get all overrides
  - `DELETE /api/led-selection/all` - Clear all overrides

#### 3. **Settings Integration**
- **Field**: `led_selection_overrides` in calibration section
- **Type**: Object/Dict `{midi_note_str: [led_indices]}`
- **Default**: Empty dict `{}`
- **Example**: `{"31": [33, 34], "32": [37, 38]}`

### Data Flow

```
User Input (API/Frontend)
    ↓
LED Selection Service
    ├─ Validate MIDI note (21-108)
    ├─ Validate LED indices
    ├─ Check LED range (start_led → end_led)
    ├─ Store in settings
    └─ Return warnings for out-of-range LEDs
    ↓
During Mapping Generation (get_canonical_led_mapping)
    1. Generate base allocation (Physics-Based or Piano-Based)
    2. Apply calibration offsets
    3. Apply LED Selection Overrides
       ├─ Replace base LEDs with selected LEDs
       ├─ Track removed LEDs
       └─ Reallocate removed LEDs to neighbors
    ↓
Final Mapping
    └─ Used for MIDI playback, visual representation
```

## Key Features

### 1. Per-LED Selection
Users can select exactly which LEDs to assign to each key:
- Override automatic allocation
- Mix and match LEDs from anywhere in the valid range
- Toggle individual LEDs on/off

### 2. Intelligent LED Reallocation
When LEDs are removed from a key:
- System finds the "best neighbor" (adjacent key)
- Prefers neighbors whose LED range is closest to removed LED
- Ensures LEDs are efficiently redistributed
- Maintains full coverage of the LED strip

**Example**:
```
Base mapping:
  MIDI 31 (Key 10): [33, 34, 35]
  MIDI 32 (Key 11): [36, 37, 38]

Override: MIDI 31 to [33, 34]

Result:
  MIDI 31 (Key 10): [33, 34]        (removed 35)
  MIDI 32 (Key 11): [35, 36, 37, 38] (35 reallocated here)
```

### 3. Validation & Safety
- **MIDI Note Validation**: Checks 21-108 range
- **LED Index Validation**: Ensures valid integers
- **LED Range Checking**: Warns about out-of-range LEDs
- **Out-of-Range Warning**: Returns helpful message with valid range

### 4. Persistence
- All overrides stored in `settings.db`
- Survives application restart
- Integrated into canonical mapping on every load
- WebSocket broadcasts notify frontend of changes

## Test Results

### Test Suite 1: Basic Functionality ✓
- Set LED selection for key: **PASS**
- Get LED selection for key: **PASS**
- Toggle LED (add): **PASS**
- Toggle LED (remove): **PASS**
- Get all overrides: **PASS**

### Test Suite 2: Reallocation ✓
- Remove rightmost LED → reallocates to right neighbor: **PASS**
- Remove leftmost LED → reallocates to left neighbor: **PASS**
- Out-of-range warning message: **PASS**

### Test Suite 3: Clear/Reset ✓
- Clear single override: **PASS**
- Auto-allocation after clear: **PASS**
- Clear all overrides: **PASS**

## Important Implementation Details

### LED Range
The valid LED range is determined by settings:
- `start_led`: First usable LED (default: 4)
- `end_led`: Last usable LED (default: 249)
- Full range: 4-249 (246 LEDs)

**This is NOT the full 0-254 range!** LEDs 0-3 and 250-254 are typically reserved or unused.

### Key Index vs MIDI Note
The service uses both internally:
- **MIDI Note**: User-facing (21-108, A0-C8)
- **Key Index**: Internal (0-87, corresponding to 88 keys)
- **Conversion**: `key_index = midi_note - 21`

### Reallocation Strategy
The `_find_best_neighbor()` method:
1. Calculates distance from removed LED to both neighbors' ranges
2. Prefers neighbor with smallest distance
3. Falls back to left/right preference if distances are equal
4. Ensures efficient adjacent allocation

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Usage (Expected)
```javascript
// Set override
await api.put('/api/led-selection/key/31', { 
  selected_leds: [33, 34] 
})

// Toggle individual LED
await api.post('/api/led-selection/key/31/toggle/35')

// Clear override
await api.delete('/api/led-selection/key/31')

// Get current settings
const overrides = await api.get('/api/led-selection/all')
```

### Backend Direct Usage
```python
from backend.services.led_selection_service import LEDSelectionService
from backend.config import get_canonical_led_mapping

svc = SettingsService()
sel_svc = LEDSelectionService(svc)

# Set override
result = sel_svc.set_key_led_selection(31, [33, 34])

# Get mapping with overrides applied
canonical = get_canonical_led_mapping(svc)
mapping = canonical['mapping']
# mapping[10] now contains [33, 34] instead of [33, 34, 35]
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Settings Service** (`backend/services/settings_service.py`)
- Provides persistence via SQLite
- Stores/retrieves overrides from `calibration.led_selection_overrides`

### 2. **Canonical Mapping** (`backend/config.py`, line ~1747)
```python
# Apply LED selection overrides (per-LED customization)
from backend.services.led_selection_service import LEDSelectionService
selection_service = LEDSelectionService(settings_service)
final_mapping = selection_service.apply_overrides_to_mapping(
    final_mapping,
    start_led=start_led,
    end_led=end_led
)
```

### 3. **MIDI Playback** (`backend/midi/midi_event_processor.py`)
- Uses `get_canonical_led_mapping()` which includes overrides
- All MIDI notes automatically use the override-aware mapping
- No changes needed - works automatically!

### 4. **WebSocket Broadcasting**
- API endpoints emit socket events when overrides change
- Event name: `led_selection_updated`
- Payload: `{midi_note, selected_leds, action}`
- Allows real-time frontend updates

## Files Modified

1. **backend/services/led_selection_service.py** (NEW, 384 lines)
   - Complete LED selection management service

2. **backend/api/led_selection.py** (NEW, ~160 lines)
   - REST API endpoints with WebSocket support

3. **backend/services/settings_service.py** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `led_selection_overrides` field to schema

4. **backend/app.py** (MODIFIED)
   - Registered `/api/led-selection` blueprint

5. **backend/config.py** (MODIFIED)
   - Integrated override application in `get_canonical_led_mapping()`

## Next Steps (Frontend Development)

To complete the feature, the frontend needs:

1. **LED Selection UI Component**
   - Display current LED allocation for selected key
   - Show valid LED range [4, 249]
   - Provide toggle/selection controls for each LED
   - Visual feedback for selected vs available LEDs

2. **Settings Integration**
   - Connect to API endpoints
   - Store user preferences in state
   - Handle WebSocket updates

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Show which LEDs are reallocated after override
   - Indicate out-of-range warnings
   - Real-time mapping visualization

## Edge Cases & Considerations

### ✓ Tested & Working
- Removing LEDs from keys at different positions (left, middle, right)
- Reallocation to both left and right neighbors
- Multiple simultaneous overrides
- Out-of-range LED warnings
- Toggle add/remove operations

### ✓ Validated
- LED range boundaries (4-249)
- MIDI note boundaries (21-108)
- Settings persistence
- Integration with auto-calibration offsets

### Consider For Future
- UI for complex selections (range selection, patterns)
- Profiles/presets for different piano configurations
- Conflict resolution if multiple users make changes
- Performance testing with all 88 keys overridden

## Performance & Resource Impact

- **Storage**: ~200 bytes per override (settings.db)
- **CPU**: O(n) reallocation per override applied
- **Memory**: Single service instance per application
- **Network**: Small JSON payloads, minimal bandwidth
