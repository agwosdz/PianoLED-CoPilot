## 💡 Key Insights

### The Problem We Solved
**Before:** How do we map LEDs to piano keys?  
**Naive Approach:** Key N → LED N (doesn't work physically)  
**Our Solution:** Map through physical distance correlation (physics-based)

### Why This Matters
- ✅ Validates physical feasibility
- ✅ Detects undersaturation/oversaturation
- ✅ Provides intelligent scoring
- ✅ Scales across all sizes
- ✅ User-friendly recommendations

### The Innovation
Instead of abstract index mapping, we:
1. Calculate piano physical width
2. Calculate LED strip physical coverage
3. Correlate distances
4. Score quality based on 3 factors
5. Generate recommendations

---

## 🔍 Testing Coverage

### Test Scenarios Covered
- ✅ Standard configuration (88-key, 60 LEDs/m)
- ✅ Undersaturated case (too few LEDs)
- ✅ Oversaturated case (too many LEDs)
- ✅ Different piano sizes (49-key)
- ✅ Different LED densities (60-200 LEDs/m)
- ✅ Physical geometry validation
- ✅ Edge cases (invalid inputs, boundaries)

### Expected Results
```
test_standard_88key ...................... PASS ✓
test_undersaturated ....................... PASS ✓
test_oversaturated ........................ PASS ✓
test_49key_different_density .............. PASS ✓
test_physical_geometry .................... PASS ✓
test_edge_cases ........................... PASS ✓ (5 sub-tests)

SUCCESS: All tests passed! ✓
