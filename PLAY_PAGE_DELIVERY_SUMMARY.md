## Color System

### Pitch-Based 12-Color Spectrum
Every MIDI note gets a color based on its pitch class:

| Note | Color | Hex | Example |
|------|-------|-----|---------|
| C | Red | #ff0000 | 🔴 |
| C# | Orange | #ff7f00 | 🟠 |
| D | Yellow | #ffff00 | 🟡 |
| D# | Y-Green | #7fff00 | 🟢 |
| E | Green | #00ff00 | 🟢 |
| F | G-Cyan | #00ff7f | 🟢 |
| F# | Cyan | #00ffff | 🔵 |
| G | C-Blue | #007fff | 🔵 |
| G# | Blue | #0000ff | 🔵 |
| A | B-Purple | #7f00ff | 🟣 |
| A# | Purple | #ff00ff | 🟣 |
| B | P-Red | #ff007f | 🟤 |

Colors repeat across octaves, creating visual harmony.

## Real-Time Synchronization

The page maintains perfect sync with playback:

```
Timeline (100ms cycle)
├── Fetch /api/playback-status
├── Get: current_time, total_duration, state
├── Update timeline indicator position
├── Update piano key highlights
├── Smooth CSS animations
└── Repeat every 100ms
```

**Result:** Smooth, professional playback visualization
