# Bug Fix: Pitch Adjustment State Not Showing Correctly ✓

## The Problem

The UI was showing **"No Adjustment Needed"** (gray badge) even when the system **actually adjusted the pitch** to fill the LED coverage gap.

**Symptom**: 
- Yellow badge should show when pitch was adjusted
- But showing gray badge instead
- `was_adjusted` was incorrectly False in response

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **three-step cascade** in `physics_led_allocation.py`:

### What Was Happening:

```
STEP 1: Initial mapping
        ↓ (get initial_max_led)

STEP 2: Calculate pitch adjustment
        ↓ pitch_info['was_adjusted'] = True
        ↓ Update analyzer: led_spacing_mm = calibrated_pitch

STEP 3: Regenerate mapping with new pitch
        ↓ (mapping improves with new pitch)

Analyze mapping with UPDATED analyzer
        ↓ PROBLEM: analyzer now has calibrated_pitch as "theoretical"
        ↓ Recalculates: "is calibrated_pitch == calibrated_pitch?"
        ↓ YES! So was_adjusted = False
        ↓ WRONG - LOST THE ADJUSTMENT INFO
```

The **analyzer.analyze_mapping()** was recalculating pitch calibration using the **updated pitch** as the new theoretical value, making it appear as though no adjustment was needed.

## The Fix

Preserve the pitch calibration info from STEP 2 **before** updating the analyzer, then use it in the final response:

```python
# STEP 2: Calculate pitch adjustment (ORIGINAL PITCH)
pitch_info = auto_calibrate_pitch(
    theoretical_pitch_mm=theoretical_pitch,  # Original pitch
    ...
)

# Store the pitch info from STEP 2 to use later
initial_pitch_info = pitch_info.copy()
was_adjusted = pitch_info['was_adjusted']  # Capture True/False here

# STEP 3: If adjusted, regenerate mapping
if was_adjusted:
    self.analyzer.led_placement.led_spacing_mm = calibrated_pitch  # Update pitch
    final_mapping, _ = self._generate_mapping(...)

# Get analysis (this will recalculate pitch, but we'll override it)
analysis = self.analyzer.analyze_mapping(...)

# IMPORTANT: Use the pitch_info from STEP 2, not the recalculated one
if was_adjusted:
    analysis['pitch_calibration'] = initial_pitch_info  # Override with REAL adjustment
```

## Key Changes

**File**: `backend/services/physics_led_allocation.py`

### Addition 1: Preserve Original Pitch Info
```python
# Store the pitch info from STEP 2 to use later (before analyzer recalculates)
initial_pitch_info = pitch_info.copy()
```

### Addition 2: Override Analysis Pitch Calibration
```python
# IMPORTANT: Use the pitch_info from STEP 2, not the recalculated one from analyze_mapping
# because analyze_mapping recalculates with the updated pitch, losing the "was_adjusted" info
if was_adjusted:
    # Override with the actual adjustment that happened
    analysis['pitch_calibration'] = initial_pitch_info
    logger.info(f"Using pitch calibration from STEP 2: was_adjusted={initial_pitch_info.get('was_adjusted')}")
```

## How It Works Now

### When Pitch IS Adjusted:
```
STEP 2: was_adjusted = True
        pitch_info saved to initial_pitch_info

STEP 3: Regenerate with new pitch

Analyze: generates pitch_calibration (but says no adjustment)

Override: analysis['pitch_calibration'] = initial_pitch_info
Result: was_adjusted = True ✓ (CORRECT)
        Badge shows YELLOW "Adjusted" ✓
```

### When Pitch Is NOT Adjusted:
```
STEP 2: was_adjusted = False
        pitch_info saved to initial_pitch_info

STEP 3: Skip regeneration (no adjustment needed)

Analyze: generates pitch_calibration (says no adjustment)

Override condition: if was_adjusted: (FALSE - skip override)
Result: was_adjusted = False ✓ (CORRECT)
        Badge shows GRAY "Optimal" ✓
```

## Data Flow

```
Backend allocate_leds()
  ├─ STEP 1: initial_mapping, initial_max_led
  ├─ STEP 2: auto_calibrate_pitch() → initial_pitch_info (SAVED)
  │          was_adjusted = True/False (CAPTURED)
  ├─ STEP 3: if was_adjusted → regenerate with new pitch
  ├─ analyze_mapping() → analysis (recalculated pitch)
  ├─ OVERRIDE if was_adjusted:
  │  └─ analysis['pitch_calibration'] = initial_pitch_info (TRUE ADJUSTMENT)
  └─ return analysis with correct was_adjusted
       ↓
API Response
  ├─ pitch_calibration_info['was_adjusted'] = True/False (CORRECT)
  ├─ pitch_calibration_info['theoretical_pitch_mm'] = original
  ├─ pitch_calibration_info['calibrated_pitch_mm'] = adjusted
  └─ pitch_calibration_info['reason'] = adjustment reason
       ↓
Frontend receives
  ├─ pitchCalibrationInfo = response data (CORRECT)
  ├─ if was_adjusted → show YELLOW badge
  └─ if not adjusted → show GRAY badge
```

## Result

✅ **Yellow badge now shows when pitch WAS adjusted**
✅ **Gray badge now shows when pitch was optimal**
✅ **Uses and Theory values display correctly**
✅ **Reason field shows why adjustment was needed**

## Testing

After this fix, verify:
1. Apply physics parameters with default LED range
2. Watch for adjustment needed (coverage gap)
3. UI should show **YELLOW** "Adjusted" badge ✓
4. Used pitch should differ from Theory pitch ✓
5. Reason should explain the adjustment ✓

The pitch adjustment indicator now **correctly reflects whether the system adjusted pitch** to achieve full LED coverage!
