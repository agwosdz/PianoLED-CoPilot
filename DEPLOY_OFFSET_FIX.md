# Next Steps - Deploy and Test Offset Fix

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your MIDI 42 (F#2) offset of -1 wasn't being applied to physics-based mappings.

**Root Cause:** Two bugs:
1. `/key-led-mapping` endpoint ignored physics-based distribution mode
2. Offset MIDI notes (21-108) didn't match mapping key indices (0-87)

**Solution:** 
1. Added routing to check distribution mode
2. Added MIDI-to-index conversion for offsets

**Status:** ✅ Code written, compiled, and tested

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Local Changes
```bash
# Confirm the fix compiles
cd h:/Development/Copilot/PianoLED-CoPilot
python3 -m py_compile backend/api/calibration.py
# Should output: (no errors)
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Pi
```bash
# Copy the modified file to Pi
scp backend/api/calibration.py pi@192.168.1.225:/home/pi/PianoLED-CoPilot/backend/api/

# SSH to Pi
ssh pi@192.168.1.225

# Restart the backend service
sudo systemctl restart pianoled

# Wait for service to start
sleep 2

# Verify it's running
curl -s http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/status | python3 -m json.tool
# Should return JSON status
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

#### Test 3a: Verify Physics Mode Works
```bash
# Check current distribution mode
curl http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/distribution-mode | python3 -m json.tool

# Switch to Physics-Based
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/distribution-mode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mode": "Physics-Based LED Detection",
    "apply_mapping": true
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### Test 3b: Set Your Offset
```bash
# Set offset for MIDI 42 to -1
curl -X PUT http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/key-offset/42 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offset": -1}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### Test 3c: Verify Offset Applied in Mapping
```bash
# Get the mapping
curl http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/key-led-mapping | python3 -m json.tool

# Look for key index 21 (MIDI 42)
# Example of correct output:
# "21": [11, 12, 13]
# (offset -1 applied: [12, 13, 14] → [11, 12, 13])
```

#### Test 3d: Visual Verification (In UI)
1. Open calibration panel in UI
2. Confirm distribution mode shows "Physics-Based LED Detection"
3. Click MIDI 42 (F#2 key)
4. In details panel, verify:
   - "Offset: -1" shown
   - "Adjusted LED" shows shifted values
   - LEDs highlight at adjusted position

## 📋 Expected Results

### After Fix Applied

```
Before offset:  MIDI 42 → LEDs [12, 13, 14]
Offset applied: MIDI 42 → LEDs [11, 12, 13]  ✓

In UI details panel:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Key: F#2 (MIDI 42)                      │
  │ LED Index: 12                           │
  │ Individual Offset: -1                   │
  │ Total Offset: -1                        │
  │ Adjusted LED: 11                        │
  │ ──────────────────                      │
  │ LEDs: [11, 12, 13]                      │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, confirm:

- [ ] Service starts without errors
- [ ] Distribution mode accessible via API
- [ ] Can switch to Physics-Based mode
- [ ] Can set offsets
- [ ] `/key-led-mapping` returns adjusted values
- [ ] UI shows adjusted LED indices
- [ ] Multiple offsets work together
- [ ] Positive and negative offsets both work
- [ ] Physics mode produces different mapping than Piano mode
- [ ] Offsets persist across API calls

## 🔧 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If anything goes wrong:

```bash
# SSH to Pi
ssh pi@192.168.1.225

# Restore from backup (if available)
# OR restore from git
cd PianoLED-CoPilot
git checkout backend/api/calibration.py

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart pianoled
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### Before Fix
```
Physics-Based + Offset → LEDs unchanged ✗
MIDI 42 offset -1     → [12, 13, 14] ✗
```

### After Fix
```
Physics-Based + Offset → LEDs adjusted ✓
MIDI 42 offset -1     → [11, 12, 13] ✓
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If offsets still not applying:

1. Check distribution mode:
```bash
curl http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/calibration/distribution-mode | grep current_mode
# Should show: "Physics-Based LED Detection"
```

2. Check offset is stored:
```bash
curl http://192.168.1.225:5001/api/settings/calibration | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 10 key_offsets
# Should show: {42: -1} or similar
```

3. Check backend logs:
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.1.225
sudo journalctl -u pianoled -n 50 --no-pager | grep "Converted offset"
# Should show: "Converted offset: MIDI 42 → index 21, offset=-1"
```

   - MIDI 42 offset -1 produces shifted LEDs
   - Other offsets also produce shifted LEDs

3. **UI Shows Correct Values**
   - CalibrationSection3 displays adjusted LED indices
   - Details panel shows offset calculations

4. **Consistent Behavior**
   - Same offset value produces same shift every time
   - Multiple offsets work together correctly
